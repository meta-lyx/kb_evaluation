Your link even says it: L = 4pi (R^2)sigma (T^4). Using L, luminosity, as the energy in this problem, you can find the radius R by doing sqrt (L/ (4pisigma (T^4)). Hope this helps everyone.Caroline · 4 years ago4 1 Comment (Stefan-Boltzmann law) L = 4pi*R^2*sigma*T^4 Solving for R we get: => R = (1/ (2T^2)) * sqrt (L/ (pi*sigma)) Plugging in your values you should get: => R = (1/ (2 (11,000K)^2)) *sqrt ( (2.7*10^32W)/ (pi * (5.67*10^-8 W/m^2K^4))) R = 1.609 * 10^11 m? · 3 years ago0 1 CommentMaybe you would like to learn more about one of these?Want to build a free website?

and Your 8-Year-Old Child8-Year-Olds Are Expanding Their WorldsBy Katherine Lee | Reviewed by Joel Forman, MDUpdated February 10, 2018Share Pin EmailPrintEight-year-olds are becoming more confident about themselves and who they are. At age 8, your child will likely have developed some interests and hobbies and will know what he or she likes or doesn't like.At the same time, children this age are learning more about the world at large and are also better able to navigate social relationships with others more independently, with less guidance from parents. At home, 8-year-olds are able to tackle more complicated household chores and take on more responsibility for taking care of themselves, even helping out with younger siblings.In general, according to the CDC, these are some changes you may see in your child:Shows more independence from parents and family.Starts to think about the future.Understands more about his or her place in the world.Pays more attention to friendships and teamwork.Wants to be liked and accepted by friends.1 Behavior and Daily RoutinesFabrice LeRouge/Getty ImagesThe 8-year-old's behavior and daily routines are shaped by the child's taste, interests, and personality. Parents and other significant adults in the child's life should keep in mind the importance of being good role models since this is a time when children are figuring out the world and who they are and how they fit into it. At this age, your child may get involved with more complex social activities and behaviors that help define his or her sense of self.Effective discipline techniques at this age include continuing to praise good behavior, focusing your child's efforts, what they can do and change, rather than innate traits (such as \"you are smart\"). Set up and enforce consistent rules. Discipline should be aimed at guiding your child rather than punishing. Follow it with a discussion with your child about what she could do differently next time.Your 8-year-old can do more self-care in regards to hygiene and may begin to want to be part of deciding what the family eats. You might begin to give your child chores to contribute to the maintenance of the household and an allowance to begin to learn to manage money. At this age, your child still needs 10 to 11 hours of sleep per night.2 Physical DevelopmentImage Source/Getty ImagesFor 8-year-old children, physical development will continue to be more about refinement of skills, coordination, and muscle control rather than huge changes. They begin to look like \"big kids,\" but puberty is still a couple of years away for most of them.Children with natural athletic potential may show their abilities at this developmental stage as their physical skills become more precise and accurate. In fact, this is often the age at which children decide whether they are athletic or not, and choose to participate in or avoid sports. Either way, it's important for parents to encourage physical activity. Even if your child isn't an athlete she can still enjoy running, swimming, biking, and many other types of non-sports-related physical fun.3 Emotional DevelopmentJohn Howard/Getty ImagesEight-year-old emotional development may be growing at a deeper level than in younger years, and an 8-year-old may show more sophisticated and complex emotions and interactions. For instance, an 8-year-old may mask true thoughts or emotions to spare someone else's feelings or work through a problem without an adult's close supervision or intervention.This is the time when your child may be developing a more sophisticated sense of himself in the world. Her interests, talents, friends, and relationship with family all help her to establish a clear self-identity. It's also the beginning of desiring privacy and flip-flopping between self-confidence and self-doubt.It can be a good time to help your child develop patience and empathy for others.4 Cognitive DevelopmentTom Merton/Getty ImagesEight-year-old children are at a stage of intellectual development where they will be able to pay attention for longer periods of time. You can expect your child to be able to concentrate on an activity for up to an hour or more. Eight-year-olds will also be able to think more critically and express opinions using more complex and sophisticated vocabulary and language skills.5 Social DevelopmentChristopher Futcher/Getty ImagesThis is the phase of social development where many children love being a part of sports teams and other social groups. In general, 8-year-old children enjoy school and will count on and value relationships with a few close friends and classmates. Parents of 8-year-olds should be on the lookout for problems such as school refusal, as this may indicate learning difficulties or being bullied at school. It is also a good age at which to discuss respecting others.6 What If My Child Is Different?Developmental milestones provide professionals and parents with a tool for comparing children to a norm. No child fits the ideal norm perfectly, and each child will have his or her personal quirks, strengths, challenges, and preferences. With that said, however, if you feel your child is far behind or ahead of the norm, it's well worth discussing the issue with your pediatrician and your child's teacher. If there are issues or opportunities, now is the time to learn about and address them.A Word From VerywellYour 8-year-old is in the full bloom of childhood. Enjoy activities and explore the world together. It's a great time to spark new interests in your child and watch her grow in every way.Sources:Anthony, Michelle.

If you become afflicted with such parasites, you must act quickly and make sure you are thorough in your efforts to get rid of them.Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need helpLice are wingless and very tiny. They infest your scalp and other body areas such as the pubic and armpit regions. Adult lice lay eggs. When the eggs hatch, they leave shells behind. These shells are called nits. When you see these nits on your scalp or on any area of the body, it is a neon sign of a lice infestation. You should know how to check for lice nits if you want to have a parasite-free body and scalp. It will definitely make you more confident when mingling with other people. Yes, it may be tedious and laborious, but this will help ensure a healthier lifestyle.Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need helpA Basic Description of LiceRecognize lice. You should definitely know how to recognize lice. These are wingless, tiny arthropods (six-legged invertebrates) that reside on your scalp. Lice are ectoparasites that rely on your blood to survive. They are about the size of a sesame seed. Lice are like mosquitoes, but instead of flying, they do best with crawling. You can get lice by being in direct contact with someone infested with head lice. Another way would be to share items such as headbands, clips, combs, or hats.Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need helpEggsThe female head lice lay eggs. These eggs are almost invisible to the naked eye because they're tiny and they blend into the color of your hair. Female head lice usually lay their eggs on the hair shafts near the hair roots. They attach with an adhesive that's naturally waterproof. That is why they cannot be blown or washed away.Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need helpBy the time the head lice eggs hatch, they leave empty eggshells behind. These are called nits. You could confuse nits with hairspray flakes, sand, or dandruff. Like the lice eggs, nits still have their adhesives so they cannot be removed that easily. Nits differ in coloration (brownish yellow, white). As the hair grows, the attached nits are found away from the roots. Since nits are indications of lice infestation, many schools do not admit children who have them. It is important for parents to check their children's heads for nits and eggs on a regular basis so that lice treatment could be performed immediately. Removing nits and lice eggs takes patience and a fine-toothed comb.Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need helpLife Cycle of Head LiceHead lice have three phases in their life cycle (40-50 days):1 Egg phase. The mature female lays eggs that are coated with an adhesive. This adhesive is effective for attaching the eggs to the hair shafts near the hair roots. The newly hatched head lice will hatch after 10 days. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Nymph phase. A nymph comes out of the head lice egg. They are not that easy to see. Nymphs cannot reproduce yet because they don't have a fully developed reproductive system yet. It takes 12 days for lice nymphs to mature. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Adult phase. This is the phase where the nymphs are finally mature enough to produce and lay eggs. Once they are sexually mature, they can lay four to 10 eggs every day. The life of adult head lice lasts about 28 days. Don't panic, but about 280 lice eggs could be laid by one mature female before she dies. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need helpHow to Check for Head Lice, Nits, and EggsYou can tell if there is a head lice infestation when the suspected host itches all the time. Oftentimes, children scratch their heads, nape, or behind the ears. Red bumps or small wounds might also be present in these areas. Once you notice itching or bumps, immediately check your child's head. There could already be a head lice outbreak in their school. You can check for head lice, nits, and eggs by using the following steps:Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need helpFirst Check For Lice1 Choose a relaxing place. Select a comfortable area for head lice checking. You should position your child seated in front of you. This will allow you to check all over your child's head conveniently. Do not do this on furniture that's upholstered, as lice may end up there. Go for a kitchen chair instead...you might even want to do this on the back deck. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Make sure there is natural light. It should be bright enough so you could detect the nits.

This is spread through sexual intercourse. If a sexual partner detects pubic lice infestation in his or her own pubic area, both sexual partners should be treated to avoid spreading the parasites again. Pubic lice are usually grey or brown. They can be acquired from infested clothes, bedding, and towels. Pubic lice look like tiny crabs and that's why they are also known as \"crabs\".

building, on Monday. Ali Haider/European Pressphoto AgencyBurdened by debt and a devastating real estate crash, Dubai is doing what it does best: doubling down.Just one month after a close brush with bankruptcy, Dubai celebrated the opening of the world’s tallest building on Monday — a rocket-shaped edifice that soars 2,717 feet and has views that reach 60 miles.The glittering celebration may have been an attempt by Dubai’s ruler, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, to shift the focus from Dubai’s current economic troubles to a future filled with more promise.All the same, the tower’s success by no means signals a recovery in Dubai’s beaten-down real estate market, where prices have collapsed by as much as 50 percent and many developers are having trouble finding occupants for their buildings.With its mix of nightclubs, mosques, luxury suites and boardrooms, the Burj is an almost perfect representation of Dubai’s own complexities and contradictions. It will have the world’s first Armani hotel; the world’s highest swimming pool, on the 76th floor; the highest observation deck, on the 124th floor; and the highest mosque, on the 158th floor.Related CoverageThe World’s Tallest Building JAN. 4, 2010Fireworks Greet Tallest SkyscraperBut in deciding to change the tower’s name from Burj Dubai to Burj Khalifa, in honor of the president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Dubai revealed a rare streak of humility consistent with its diminished economic condition. Once the most proudly autonomous of Arab Emirates, Dubai has found that its financial troubles have made it more dependent on Abu Dhabi and more likely to be drawn closer into the federation.“Dubai not only has the world’s tallest building, but has also made what looks like the most expensive naming rights deal in history,” said Jim Krane, the author of “City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism.” “Renaming the Burj Dubai after Sheik Khalifa of Abu Dhabi — if not an explicit quid pro quo — is a down payment on Dubai’s gratitude for its neighbor’s $10 billion bailout last month.”The opening festivities had the feel of a national holiday, with fireworks, parachute jumps and shooting streams of water from the world’s tallest fountain.At a cost estimated at $1.5 billion, the Burj took five years to build, is more than 160 floors high and has comfortably surpassed the previous record holder in Taiwan, the Taipei 101.More than 12,000 people will occupy its six million square feet, zooming up and down in 54 elevators that can reach speeds of 40 miles an hour. It was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in Chicago.At a time when several of Dubai’s newly built office towers stand empty, it is 90 percent sold, according to the building’s developer, Emaar Properties.To be sure, some have questioned the utility of such a towering project. At least three foreign workers died during the construction. And at a time of increasing concerns over global terrorism, such a building could pose an inviting target.The Burj Khalifa was named in honor of the president of Abu Dhabi.Charles Crowell/Bloomberg NewsBut to Dubai, which from its very beginning has taken pleasure in proving its doubters wrong, the Burj is evidence that if you build it big and brash enough the people will come, from near and far.With its strong government backing and unquestioned prestige, the Burj was a project that was destined to succeed and its developer, Emaar, had little difficulty in attracting residents — particularly since much of the space was sold several years ago in the middle of Dubai’s real estate frenzy.Other projects, however, have not been so lucky. One is the Omniyat Bayswater, a 24-story office building that stands less than half a mile from the Burj. It opened six months ago and remains more than 50 percent vacant.Sign up for the all-new DealBook newsletterOur columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.Sign UpYou agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.See Sample Privacy PolicyOpt out or contact us anytimeAimed to be the flagship structure of an ambitious development project in an area by the sea called Business Bay, Omniyat Bayswater has been unable to attract tenants as a consequence of the current real estate crisis.But its struggle speaks to a larger truth behind the Dubai real estate bubble which, despite the excitement over the Burj, could well forestall a meaningful recovery.Like many office projects developed four or five years ago, the peak years of Dubai’s expansion, the Omniyat Bayswater is plagued by splintered ownership. It is estimated to have more than 50 landlords — more than two per floor — with some trying to lease office suites as small as 1,000 square feet.A spokesman for Omniyat said that the developer recognized the problem of multiple owners, and had taken steps to address it and expected to see whole floors leased by the second quarter of this year.At a time when selling real estate was like handing out candy to children, the development model of selling to many owners, known as strata title, became a quick and easy way to finance building projects. Speculators from around the world were clamoring for the smallest slice of Dubai property.But with the crash, the building’s ownership structure has made it extremely difficult to sell or lease a floor or two to foreign companies seeking to expand.“There has been a difficulty in creating a collective of owners,” said Nick Maclean of the real estate firm CB Richard Ellis in Dubai. “The majority of the building is empty.”Few offers have been made for space in buildings under strata title, which is estimated to cover about two-thirds of the new buildings opening this year and 70 percent of those opening in 2011. Without government action, office vacancy rates could rise as high as 40 percent, according to real estate analysts.As for the effect the Burj will have on the overall market, Mr. Maclean said that its opening, while heartening, was unlikely to prompt an immediate turn around in the market.“It is a unique building and symbolically important but it is not going to stimulate demand,” he said.Correction: January 7, 2010An article on Tuesday about the opening of the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, misstated the position of Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, for whom the tower is named. He is president of the United Arab Emirates, not of Abu Dhabi. (He is emir of Abu Dhabi.) The error also appeared in a picture caption accompanying the article and was repeated in an editorial on Wednesday. The editorial also misstated the beneficiary of a $10 billion loan from Abu Dhabi. It was the emirate of Dubai, not the United Arab Emirates.A version of this article appears in print on January 5, 2010, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Dubai Opens A Tower To Beat All.

Weeds are never completely eradicated because their seeds fall into the soil and remain viable. By taking the time to remove the weeds, you will keep the other vegetation safe. Some steps will help you keep many of the weeds from coming back into the garden.Things You'll NeedGardening glovesPre-emergent herbicideSelective herbicide or post-emergent herbicideMulchNewspaperPull the weeds by hand. Put on some gardening gloves and grasp the weed as close to the soil line as possible. Give a quick pull and the weed should come out of the ground--roots and all. It the weeds do not pull easily, or if they break off at the stem, water the area first.Apply a pre-emergent herbicide to the soil. It will kill weeds--but not your flowers or other grasses--before the weeds begin to grow. This type of herbicide prevents the weed seeds from germinating and is safe to use around plants. Apply according to label directions.Spray the area with a selective herbicide or a post-emergent herbicide designed to kill weeds but not grass and flowers. Read and follow label directions for application and amounts, as they can vary. Ask the clerk at the garden center for the correct herbicide.Lay down a 2- to 4-inch layer of mulch, if possible. If you have a lot of space between plants, place 12 sheets of newspaper over the soil between plants. Cover the newspaper with mulch and the water it down to keep the newspaper on the ground when wind blows.  \n",
      "8   In World War 2, the three great Allied leaders against Germany were President Roosevelt , Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union. Three finer war leaders could not have been found at any time in history. Churchill, a leader with bulldog tenacity and possessing fine oratorical skills, Stalin, the man of steel, and Roosevelt, the great politician and compromisor, held the allies together when things looked blackest and then led them to victory over the fanatical resistance of the Germans and Japanese.On the other side of the war, Hitler, although an evil person, also had his moments of leadership particularly at the start of the war. But none of the other Axis leaders (certainly not Mussolini!) were of the caliber of the three Allied leaders. Hitler was outnumbered three to one when it came to leadership.This web site deals with President Roosevelt during World War 2. He had followed Herbert Hoover as president in 1933 shortly after the Great Depression began and served as president until 1945 when he died in office just as World War 2 was ending. Vice-President Harry Truman succeeded Roosevelt as president and led America in the immediate post-World War 2 era as the cold war began.FDR's close ties to Winston Churchill are discussed on this web site. `\" The only thing we have to fear is fear itself .\"President Roosevelt.Roosevelt was one of America's greatest presidents. To me, he has always been the perfect example of what an American president should be. Depending on the crisis at hand, Roosevelt undertook whatever corrective steps he thought needed to be taken. A child of the upper class, he, nevertheless, felt it was his duty to help those less fortunate than himself and he initiated the New Deal.The president's wife (and fifth cousin), Eleanor Roosevelt, also had strong feelings in that direction and encouraged FDR in his efforts. Although he often had to compromise with his rich and powerful friends, he was a true champion of the \"forgotten man.\"President Roosevelt was conscious of the power of the presidency and used it as no one ever had before. He worked his way through two major crises in his 4 terms as president: the Great Depression and World War 2.U.S. Unprepared at Beginning of World War 2. After Czechoslovakia fell to Germany in 1938, Roosevelt felt sure that Europe would erupt into war and that the U.S. would be drawn in. He knew the British and French were our natural allies and that Germany was wrong in its forced acquisition of surrounding nations. Even though he knew which side we must support, he could make no overt maneuvers because this country, including Congress, was militantly isolationist at the time. There was opposition to war from both the right and the left.The right wingers were particularly adamant in their opposition. Some even wanted to join Hitler and the Nazis and attack Russia to clean out the communists who they thought were the \"real\" enemy (worse than Hitler!? The right-wingers were a little out of touch with reality).So, even though President Roosevelt watched country after country fall into Nazi Germany's hands in 1939, 1940 and 1941, he was unable to attempt a rescue because American public support was not there.United States Prepares For WarAll in all, the United States was lightly armed in 1938. The Navy was adequate but the army was woefully small. Roosevelt had to get the country ready for war he knew was probably coming but in such a manner as to not upset the isolationists. He had to move slowly: He did a wonderful job in this effort.1. In November of 1938, President Roosevelt startled his military advisers by advocating the production of 10,000 military aircraft by 1940 and providing the capacity to produce 10,000 planes per year thereafter. This advice did not set well with some advisors who wanted a more balanced approach. But Roosevelt was trying to let Hitler know what America could produce if aroused. He was hoping to discourage Hitler's aggression.2. In July of 1939, Roosevelt issued a military order moving agencies related to defense to report directly to the President and not to the various official government department heads. This created some confusion since the department heads were often left out of matters. However, the order provided a personal relationship between the president and the military chiefs. This is the way Roosevelt liked to work. It also magnified the power of the military chiefs which was a good thing as the nation prepared for war.3. In September of 1940, Roosevelt made a destroyer deal with Great Britain providing them with 50 World War I destroyers in return for a string of bases in the Caribbean.4. In September of 1940, the Selective Service Act was passed and Americans began to be drafted.5. In early 1941, President Roosevelt had Congress pass the \"Lend-Lease Act\" which provided Britain and Russia with arms via lease but with no conditions for repayment. As the president said, \"When your neighbor's house is on fire, one does not haggle over the price to put it out, the hose is readily loaned and the price is figured later.\"America was slowly getting ready for war!U.S. Enters World War 2.On December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and, on December 11th, Germany declared war on the U.S. (A big mistake by Hitler - otherwise, we might have concentrated on beating Japan first). America was now in World War 2! Americans were no longer isolationists - they were mad as hell and they were not going to take it! Overseas, Churchill, despite the disaster, could not help but feel a great relief (actually he was ecstatic) that America was now in the war. He later wrote,\"No American will think it wrong of me if I proclaim that to have the United States at our side was to me the greatest joy.............but now at this very moment I knew the United States was in the war, up to the neck and in to the death. So we had won after all! Yes, after Dunkerque; after the fall of France; .......after the threat of invasion......after seventeen months of lonely fighting.........We had won the war. England would live;.........Our history would not come to an end....Hitler's fate was sealed.........there was no more doubt about the end.\"Churchill could relax for a moment after standing up to the Nazis, virtually alone, for two years. In retrospect, Churchill's optimistic outlook only partly came true. The Allies won the war all right and both Germany and Japan were defeated. But the British Empire was doomed as the nations who made up the commonwealth began to fly the coop after the war and, finally, Britain was the only significant power left. Although Bitain ended up on the winning side, the empire was finished as were other empires, e.g., German, Italian, French, and Japanese empires.Roosevelt - Churchill Relationship During World War 2.Just prior to the start of World War 2 in September 1939, President Roosevelt had written Churchill (Churchill was not yet prime minister) and the two opened a correspondence and began a warm friendship that would last until Roosevelt's death in 1945 although problems began to occur near the end because of Roosevelt's hesitancy in joining Churchill in moving to limit Soviet Union expansionism. This close relationship between the two leaders, of course, spilled over into the relationship between the countries. It led to the creation of the Combined Chiefs of Staff which was a joint military command over all British-American operations. It also led to the development of a second front in France, development of an atomic bomb, creation of the United Nations, and final defeat of the axis powers.President Roosevelt as Commander-in Chief During World War 2.Prior to the war and for the first year or so of World War 2, President Roosevelt functioned as the \"real\" Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. armed forces. This is an authority that all presidents have a constitutional right to exercise but few do. Roosevelt was personally involved in all major decisions. One reason for this is that the enemy had the initiative early on and America was developing a strategy to counter the assault and seize the initiative. Alternative methods of conducting the war had to be considered and the president had to decide which way to go. (See Planning & Strategy for more on strategy.)Once the war had gone on for awhile, the tide had turned, America and its allies had the initiative, and a master plan had been developed, so there was no need for President Roosevelt to be so heavily involved. Also, as the war proceeded, the military command system became too large for the personal control Roosevelt liked to exercise. Now he had to depend on theater commanders, the planning staffs, etc. He still used the personal touch with Churchill and his top military advisors but he could no longer control events as he did in pre-war days. This was true of strategy development and in operational planning. Roosevelt was not above stepping in on certain occasions but, essentially, control of military details had shifted to others closer to the action.President Roosevelt still maintained close contact with events through his top assistants - Harry Hopkins and Admiral William Leahy - whom he relied heavily on in making wartime decisions. Early in the conflict, Roosevelt relied more on Hopkins than his military chiefs, however, this changed as the war went on. For his part, Leahy served as a liaison officer or, as Roosevelt called him, \"a sort of leg man,\" transmitting information between the President and the Joint Chiefs. Leahy was a perfect man for the job due to his military seniority, personal friendship with the President, and personality. Largely due to his efforts, the views of the President and the military chiefs never drifted far apart as had occasionally happened early in the war.Roosevelt as Commander-in-Chief - Operation TORCH. Early in the war in 1942, Roosevelt was still acting as the \"real\" Commander-in-Chief and moved forcibly on a critical strategic decision.A joint American - British decision for a cross-channel invasion of France in 1943 (Operation OVERLORD) had been made early on. The plan had been endorsed enthusiastically by the Americans and reluctantly by the British. As time went by, the two sides began squabbling over whether the invasion of France should actually be made in 1943 or delayed until 1944. The American military chiefs even went so far as to recommend that, if the British did not go along with the U.S. invasion plan, the Americans should drop the prevailing Europe-first strategy and begin to move forces to the Pacific theater. In July 1942, Roosevelt intervened strongly in the dispute. He said he would not allow any diversion of forces from Europe to the Pacific. In effect, the British approach won out because of the president's intervention. Instead of an invasion of Europe in 1943, a much less aggressive landing of forces was made in North Africa (Operation TORCH) in late 1942. This substitute action for the now-delayed Operation OVERLORD held the British - American coalition together and the Europe-first strategy was preserved. In retrospect, the decision to delay was probably the correct one because we really were not fully ready for an invasion in 1943. Casualties would have been immense, and indeed, the invasion might have failed.It should be noted that Stalin became infuriated with the postponement of Operation OVERLORD. He was in favor of a second front as early as possible to take pressure off his country. The Russians were already taking immense casualties - they were not that concerned that others might have to share taking casualties with them.Roosevelt Contrasted to Churchill as Leaders During World War 2. Roosevelt's usual hands-off approach as Commander-in-Chief was unlike his restless friend Churchill's approach. Churchill could not refrain from meddling with the British commanders in the matters of tactics and strategy. It should be noted here that, for all his greatness, Churchill's meddling did not always have a happy ending as he often wanted to move the allied thrusts to obscure (e.g., invade the \"soft underbelly of Europe\") theaters away from the primary theater. At these times, he sometimes seemed to act as a child playing with his toys. He had had the same problem in World War I when he initiated the doomed attack on Galipoli, Turkey, a disaster which cost him his position. He was almost - but not quiet - as bad a meddler with the military leaders as Hitler was on the German side.Roosevelt and Churchill had much different personalities. Roosevelt was a very political man, a man who used his charm, a compromisor, and a man who tried to avoid any controversy. His approach was always the indirect approach. (Had Roosevelt been a military man, he would have followed the \"indirect approach\" of Liddell Hart.) And by no means was Roosevelt an open man. He did not easily reveal his reasons for making decisions so his subordinates constantly had to try to read his mind and it did not appear to bother him at all to keep them guessing. The Bronx political leader, Edward Flynn, once observed of Roosevelt, \"Roosevelt would adopt ideas only if he believed in them. If he disagreed, he simply did nothing.\"Churchill, on the other hand, had a very opposite personality. His was the direct approach. He loved controversy and debate. He presented his ideas openly and loudly with much documentation and with great fervor. His associates and critics alike were allowed to do the same. He was an 'open read'. You always knew where Churchill stood on an issue. Because of his pugnacious disposition, Churchill was always getting knocked about by someone and had often, in his career, lost whatever job he might have at the time. But he had great tenacity and always got back on his feet full of fight.Such different men!.... but together, they made a great team. They, along with Stalin, ran World War and won it.The World War 2 Conferences. A number of conferences were held between Roosevelt and Churchill during World War 2. The Casablanca Conference between Roosevelt and Churchill was one of the more important conferences. A decision was made at this conference that no peace would be concluded with the Axis except on the basis of \"unconditional surrender.\" This was done partly to placate the always suspicious Soviets that America and Britain would not seek a separate peace with Germany leaving the Soviets \"holding the bag.\" Some critics say that this action unnecessarily lengthened World War 2 and caused unnecessary casualties. Politically, though, it was probably necessary.Two of the last conferences were held at Teheran and Yalta and included Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin. Here the long range objectives of the United States and Britain began to deviate and some strain began to show on the friendship of Roosevelt and Churchill.Churchill had been looking ahead to the post-World War 2 period and had perceived that the Soviet Union was going to be a problem with its expansive goals and its communistic ideology.Roosevelt was less concerned about the Russians. He was more concerned about America getting caught up in the rebuilding of Europe and the possibility that they might have to station troops there indefinitely. He apparently felt that Americans would revert to their isolationists ways after the war and he had to get the country out of Europe as soon as possible. He also accepted the idea that Russia would have an expanded role in Europe after the war. Critics have long criticized Roosevelt in this aspect of his policy. To some, he sold out to the Soviets. To others, he was so anxious to end the war fast and get out of Europe that he ignored long-range political aspects which make up so large a part of war.There is no doubt that the rapidly deteriorating health of President Roosevelt's health affected his performance during the last months of his life and contributed to his weakness regarding the Russians during the last two conferences.President Roosevelt's Death.President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, a little over two weeks before the death of Hitler and a month before Germany surrendered and the European part of World War 2 ended. After his death, Churchill wrote Eleanor: \"I have lost a dear and cherished friendship which was forged in the fire of war.\"Overall, Roosevelt was a wonderful leader for America. He pulled us through both the great depression of the 30s and the World War 2. He made his share of mistakes. For example, there is no doubt that he waffled on the Jewish problem even as news of German atrocities toward the Jews began to be publicized. However, when you look at how the other American leaders have handled different crisis in the twentieth century, he was, in my opinion, clearly superior to all the others.Web Sites: President Roosevelt In World War 2.1.

meds to be easier to swallowll?Follow 5 answersAnswersRelevanceRatingNewestOldestBest Answer: If you have a problem swallowing, try crushing Valium (or other tablets) between two spoons, and taking them in a teaspoon of your favorite Jelly (raspberry???). The jelly helps the crushed meds slide down ~Anonymous · 10 years ago0 2 CommentAsker's ratingAsk your pharmacist if any or all of your meds can be made into syrup form if you have trouble swallowing. Many forms of medication are designed to be swallowed whole and not interferred with. Do not take advice from those people on here who are only guessing at a correct answer. Seek the advice of professionals.Lady spanner · 10 years ago0 0 CommentI'm pretty sure its not a good idea to crush pills. You should definitely ask your doctor before doing anything like that, it might be dangerous.littleWing · 10 years ago0 0 CommentPlease ask your doctor! This is not a question for random people to answer. Medication is not something to mess around with. Look at Heath Ledger. He will be missed by everyone, especially his daughter. Don't make the same mistake.pink · 10 years ago0 1 CommentYour doctor or any pharmacist should be able to tell you. Could vary for each medication.Bosco · 10 years ago0 0 CommentMaybe you would like to learn more about one of these?Glucose Monitoring Devices Considering an online college?Need migraine treatment?

company to resolve your complaints quickly and completely, you may need to change the way you deal with customer service.According to the latest data from the American Customer Service Index, Americans are increasingly dissatisfied with the companies they deal with. In the first quarter of 2014, overall customer satisfaction scores across all industries fell to 76.2 out of 100, which the researchers who compile the ratings say was “one of the largest [drops] in the 20-year history of the Index.” And some industries are particularly hated: Internet (63 out of 100) and cable and subscription TV (65) companies and airlines (69) rank at the bottom when it comes to customer satisfaction.Part of the dissatisfaction may be because we are interacting with customer service the wrong way. A report released Wednesday by customer-service software firm Zendesk, which looked at customer-service interactions from more than 25,000 companies across 140 countries, as well as insight from customer-service experts, found that some consumers are acting in ways that aren’t yielding them good results.Here are four strategies to employ when dealing with customer service.Don’t be too sternBeing “overbearing” or “overly stern” is “a common strategy for some customers seeking better service,” the Zendesk survey revealed. “However, the data indicates that customers who are polite tend to submit higher customer satisfaction scores than those who aren’t.” Indeed, customers who ask the customer service rep to “please” help them with their request, and who said “thank you” for help they received throughout the call reported that they got better customer service than those who did not use these words, the survey showed.Of course, it could be that people who use these words tend to be more satisfied anyway. But there’s a strong chance that saying these platitudes ingratiates the customer service rep to you -- making them more willing to help you quickly and kindly with your request, experts say. “If you can find any excuse at all to praise them and build them up -- ‘you’re very good at what you do,’ ‘I really appreciate the extra effort,’ — people will almost always bend over backwards to maintain that good opinion and to show you just how good they really are,” says Barry Maher, the author of “Filling the Glass,” which focuses in part on getting better customer service and on personal empowerment. “Treat people well who aren’t used to being treated well…and you may well be astonished by the results you get.” Chip Bell, the founder of business consulting firm Chip Bell Group and author of “The 9 1/2 Principles of Innovative Service” adds that “you don’t have to be from the South to show respect with a liberal amount of ‘sir’ and ‘ma’am — it will open doors otherwise closed.”At the very least, “don’t go in guns a’ blazing,” says Shep Hyken, author of “Amaze Every Customer Every Time.” “The moment you lose your cool is the moment you lose control.” And, if that kindness does not work — rather than starting to get nasty — simply ask to speak to a higher authority, says Maher.Take notesTake a lesson from Rich Davis, the Comcast customer who recorded his call with the company and saw it go viral: It often pays to have good records of the antics a company is up to if you want to get your way down the road. “Have you ever heard a recording when you call for assistance that stated, ‘be advised this call may be recorded for quality assurance,’?” says motivational coach and speaker Chantay Bridges. “Flip the script, let the rep know: you are documenting them and keeping a record, that their service is also being noted.” While few customers keep detailed notes or recordings of their interactions, experts say, this will help them should there be a problem down the road, as they’ll have proof of what went on.Don’t keep your problems to yourselfMost customers know that they should contact customer service via multiple channels like phone, email and social media to get their complaint resolved ASAP. But few take the logical next step: contacting competitors via these channels too to explain how their current company is not serving their needs. “If you receive a response from a competitor, watch or ask for a counter from the business you originally were contacting,” says John Huehn, CEO of In the Chat, which provides social media and text messaging platforms to enhance customer service. This could provide you with the leverage you need to get your issue resolved.It’s OK to keep it briefWhen it comes to email complaints, longer isn’t better, so don’t waste your breath (you might, after all, need that energy for dealing with the company later on). While experts often advise consumers to give customer service reps as many details as possible so they can effectively fix the customer’s complaint, customers who wrote long emails didn’t report getting any better customer service than those who wrote short ones, the Zendesk survey revealed. Indeed, the customer’s satisfaction levels at the end of the exchange were roughly the same whether they wrote 50 words or 200 words. Jason Maynard, product manager and data science lead at Zendesk, says that this doesn’t mean you should not include detail (indeed, that helps) but that you should make this detail as succinct as possible; if you have a complicated problem or request, you may want to consider calling, as most of us aren’t trained as technical writers.  \n",

                                           What is \"Formwork\"?Formwork is the walls that support the concrete until its set. It forms a mould. The best material for formwork is timber at least 25mm thick and equal in width to the concrete thickness.Formwork for Concrete PathsUse structural plywood or hardboard.For curved paths, hardboard or 7mm plywood is suitable but requires more supporting pegs.Forms must be strong, smooth on the top edge and well supported with stout pegs. (A good test for the strength of formwork is its ability to withstand a reasonable kick).Formwork must be deep enough to hold the thickness of concrete placed and to prevent slurry escaping underneath.Plywood FormworkPlywood formwork from your local building supply or timber yard is easy to cut to shape and can be reused for several jobs. You can cut enough formwork from a standard 2440mm x 1220mm sheet to make a path 1 metre wide and about 10 metres long.Place the forms along the borders marked out with string.2) Secure forms in position with stout pegs driven into the ground inside and outside the forms.The outside pegs should be placed at more frequent intervals and the forms nailed to them.Hammer the pegs down to below the height of the forms.Coat the formwork lightly with thin oil or form oil to be removed easily later.Soak the ground and forms thoroughly with water - the night before the pour.Dampen again before the Boral Concrete truck arrives. The ground should be damp but not muddy.Place reinforcement (check if required)Areas like garage floors require reinforcing with mesh or similar. Local building regulations sometimes demand the use of reinforcement. For information on what types of mesh to use and how to cut and place it, contact one of the steel fabric mesh suppliers eg. Bluescope Steel.Check your measurementsOnce you’ve got the formwork sorted and a few other preparations are complete, do one final check on the quantity of concrete you require. IMPORTANT! Check the THICKNESS. Remember - if your slab has an average thickness of 10% more than your original measurements you will need at least 10% more concrete to complete your job. > Step 5 – Placing the Concrete> Back to DIY Concrete steps> Safety Advice  \n",

the times when they urinate. In some cases, the loss of urine is so small that people are hardly aware of it. In other cases, the amount of leakage is quite large. Only about 10 percent of people who suffer from incontinence seek treatment. Without treatment, many of these people stay at home and withdraw from life unnecessarily. Incontinence is not a disease, but it can be a symptom of disease.Is urinary incontinence caused by aging?Incontinence occurs in all age groups but is most common in the elderly. It is the most common reason for people going into nursing homes.Does pregnancy cause urinary incontinence?Pregnant women may have a small amount of urine leakage due to the pressure of the baby against the bladder and the muscles that support it. Usually, this leakage occurs when the woman coughs or sneezes. The problem generally goes away within three or four months after the baby is born. It is helpful if the woman does exercises, called Kegel exercises, to strengthen the muscles. Sometimes, women who have had children are more likely to develop incontinence when they get older due to weakening of the muscles that support the bladder. This is sometimes treated by medications, but surgery may be needed in some cases.Which diseases can cause incontinence?Diabetes, strokes and nerve diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. These diseases can damage the nerves that control the bladder which is where urine is stored before it leaves the body. These diseases can also weaken the \"sphincter,\" a ring of muscle around the opening of the bladder. This ring usually keeps urine from leaking out. Men can have incontinence from problems such as overgrowth of the prostate gland or cancer of the prostate gland, both of which can block the flow of urine. In these cases, urine leaks out when the bladder becomes too full.How can I tell if I have urinary incontinence?If you are having urine leakage, you should seek medical care to find out the cause. The doctor will ask you about your medical history and order laboratory tests. The doctor will also examine you. Sometimes, special tests may be done. In one of these, the bladder is filled with fluid. You will then be asked to repeat the action that usually causes you to have urine leakage, such as coughing or straining. X-rays and other measurements are then done to help the doctor find out why you are having the urine leakage.Are there any treatments?Yes. Urine leakage can often be stopped or lessened after the doctor finds the cause. Some treatments that have helped other people include drugs, behavioral therapy, special exercises, biofeedback, electrical stimulation and surgery.DRUGS: Several drugs are available for treating incontinence, depending on what is causing your problem. Some of these drugs, called \"bladder relaxants,\" prevent urine leakage by decreasing bladder contractions. Another type of drug helps some kinds of incontinence by strengthening muscle contractions at the outlet of the bladder. Estrogens also have been helpful for some women after menopause. A nasal spray that causes you to make less urine is also used for day and nighttime urine leakage (bed-wetting).BEHAVIORAL THERAPY: You can work with a specially trained therapist who will help you to control your urine leakage.EXERCISE: You can learn to do special exercises to strengthen the muscles that prevent leakage of urine from the bladder.BIOFEEDBACK: These techniques also help you to gain control over your bladder and to strengthen the sphincter muscle.ELECTRICAL STIMULATION: This method can help you to strengthen your sphincter muscle and keep your bladder from contracting when you do not want this to happen.SURGERY: Usually, your doctor will first try medical treatments such as drugs, biofeedback, etc. If these do not work, surgery may be planned. Some types of urinary incontinence due to weakness of the sphincter can be corrected by strengthening the muscle with surgery. A newer technique involves injecting collagen (a protein material) around the urethra to support and compress the sphincter muscle.What if these treatments do not work?These treatments should bring relief to most people who have urinary incontinence. However, if the treatments do not work for you, many absorbent protective pads are available to use. In men, a special sheath, known as a condom catheter, may be worn around the penis to drain the urine into a bag.Sometimes, a tube called an in-dwelling catheter may be placed into the bladder to drain urine continuously. This method can cause problems, such as infections, and should be used only in special cases as a permanent form of treatment. Another approach is to use a catheter several times a day to drain the bladder.Will incontinence prevent me from being active sexually?Not necessarily. Often, there is no physical reason why a person with incontinence cannot be sexually active. However, some of the diseases that cause incontinence, such as multiple sclerosis and diabetes, also may decrease the ability to perform sexually.  \n",

     Abnormal Vaginal Bleeding in Midlife and BeyondOverviewWomen of any age can have abnormal vaginal bleeding (irregular menstrual periods). Abnormal bleeding can also come from the uterus and other organs in the pelvis.During midlife, women’s hormone levels slowly decrease. This normal change can cause irregular bleeding. Usually this type of bleeding stops around the time a woman has her final period (menopause).Abnormal vaginal bleeding can also be caused by:Infection of the vagina or uterusUrinary tract infectionOther medical conditionsUterine fibroidsGrowths in the pelvic organs, including cancerAlso, some medications may affect vaginal bleeding.Call us to schedule an exam if you have vaginal bleeding that:Is heavier or lasts longer than usual.Occurs after you’ve completed menopause (12 months of no periods).Treatment is based on the cause of your vaginal bleeding. It may include medication, nonsurgical procedures, and surgery.CausesChanges in your bleeding patterns are normal during midlife stages.PerimenopausePerimenopause is the time period before your menstrual cycle ends. Usually it begins several years before menopause. For some women, it starts as early as their mid-30s or early 40s. There’s no way to tell how long perimenopause will last.You may be in perimenopause if your periods are:Irregular, with longer or shorter cycles (time between periods).Lighter or heavier than has been usual for you.Irregular periods occur when you’re no longer ovulating (releasing an egg) every month.MenopauseWhen you have not had a menstrual period for 12 months in a row, you’ve completed menopause.Menopause usually happens several years after you first have perimenopause symptoms.If you have vaginal bleeding after menopause, call us to schedule an exam.Symptoms and DiagnosisUnusual bleeding from the uterus that is not due to growths (fibroids or polyps) is called dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB).Bleeding can be heavy or light. During perimenopause, it’s usually due to natural changes, including:Changes in hormone levelsNo ovulation (anovulation)To find out what’s causing DUB, we may:Perform a pelvic exam.Do blood and urine tests.Check a tissue sample (biopsy).Related ConditionsAbnormal bleeding can also result from this range of medical conditions.Infections of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries can include:Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)Genital warts on the vulva or in the vaginaUrinary tract infection (UTI) can cause bleeding from the bladder. UTI or bladder infection symptoms include:Pink or light-brown urineBlood in the urinePain when urinatingFrequent need to urinateThyroid problems occur especially in women over 40.An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) can cause heavy and prolonged vaginal bleeding.An overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) can cause unusual bleeding.A noncancerous growth in the pituitary gland  (prolactinoma) can cause abnormal bleeding. The pituitary gland at the base of your brain produces hormones, including prolactin.Cushing’s syndrome is caused by a growth in the pituitary gland. It causes high levels of cortisol in the blood. Cortisol is a hormone that helps your body respond to stress.Vaginal dryness, a common symptom of menopause, can cause bleeding during sex with intercourse.Other CausesGrowths in one of the pelvic organs can cause unusual bleeding.Uterine fibroids are noncancerous growths in the wall of the uterus. Fibroids can be as small as a seed or as large as a grapefruit. They can grow as a single tumor or in several places.Women are most likely to have fibroids in midlife. Sometimes they occur in younger women.Fibroids may cause no symptoms. Or they may cause:Periods to occur more oftenMenstrual crampsBack painProblems with bowel movements or urinationPain during intercourseA cervical polyp is a small fingerlike growth on the cervix or in the uterus. We sometimes find cervical polyps during a pelvic exam. They are usually noncancerous (benign).Hormone-producing tumors are growths that can change your menstrual cycles. We diagnose such tumors using:Physical examBlood testsUltrasound examCancers of the uterus, cervix, and vagina are serious diseases. Be sure to be screened regularly by your doctor for these conditions.HemorrhoidsBleeding from hemorrhoids can be mistaken for vaginal bleeding. Hemorrhoids occur when the veins around your bottom (rectum and anus) swell and bleed.Hemorrhoids cause:ItchingPainA hard lump around the anusHemorrhoids usually go away within a few days. Let us know if you have a hemorrhoid that does not heal.Injury or traumaThe genital area may be injured and bleed during:SexTampon insertionStrenuous exerciseIf a tampon or other object is left in your vagina, it can cause irregular bleeding. We can check for these injuries by giving you a pelvic exam.Medications That May Affect BleedingMany medications can cause unusual vaginal bleeding. You might have:Lighter or heavier periodsLess or more frequent bleedingSkipped periodsMedications that can change your regular bleeding pattern include:Aspirin and other anticoagulant medicines (Coumadin)Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (ibuprofen)Birth control pillsBirth control injections (Depo-Provera)Contraceptive implants (Implanon)IUD (Mirena intrauterine device)Hormone therapyMedications for other conditions that can affect your bleeding patterns include:Psychiatric medications, such as antidepressantsSeizure medications (Dilantin)Corticosteroids (Prednisone)Medicines to prevent organ transplant rejectionChemotherapy for cancer (Cytoxan or tamoxifen)Radiation therapyThyroid medicines (Synthroid, Levothroid)If you think your menstrual bleeding changes may be related to medication, let us know.If the medication you’re taking has not been prescribed by a doctor, stop taking it and call us.Help for Partner AbuseUnfortunately, abusive relationships are common. Abuse can be physical, sexual, or psychological harm. It may include pressuring or forcing you to have sex or do things you are not comfortable with or refusing to use a condom to protect against pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).If this is happening to you, you can get help by talking to us, or you can:Contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 or 1-800-787-3224 for hearing/speech impaired or at www.thehotline.org.Visit the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673 or at www.rainn.org.Additional References:Abnormal Vaginal Bleeding in Midlife and Beyond: TreatmentsMenopauseMenopause and Irregular BleedingMenstruationCushing's SyndromeHyperparathyroidismPituitary Gland ConditionsBladder Problems and Infections (Urinary Tract Infections)FibroidsHemorrhoidsCervical Cancer Screening (Pap Test)Domestic ViolencePDF Link to Everyone Deserves a Safe RelationshipIf you have an emergency medical condition, call 911 or go to the nearest hospital.

act of one party claiming the legal rights of another that it has reimbursed for losses. Subrogation occurs in property/casualty insurance when a company pays one of its insured’s for damages, then makes its own claim against others who may have caused the loss, insured the loss, or contributed to it.For Example: Suppose another driver runs a red light and your car is totaled. You have insurance on your car, so you call your insurance carrier and they pay you for all of your expenses related to the accident. Your insurance company, realizing that the other driver had an insurance policy, then seeks reimbursement from the at-fault party’s insurance carrier. Your insurer is “subrogated” to the rights of your policy and can “step in your shoes” to recover any amount paid out on your behalf. This is the definition of subrogation.Policy TypesSubrogation can apply to all different types of policies, personal and business related. Example :Suppose your child starts a fire at their school causing $6,000.00 in damages. The juvenile court orders you to pay for the damages to the school. You might have coverage for this incident under the negligent supervision clause of your homeowner’s insurance policy. You should contact them immediately to find out if coverage applies. What if you arrive at your business and discover it is destroyed by fire caused by a defective copier that you purchased. Your insurance company would pay the claim and then subrogate against the manufacturer of the copier to recover the expenses paid out. Most insurance companies would attempt to recover any out-of- pocket expense you might incur as well.Why it is important to youWhy is subrogation becoming so important in the insurance industry and how can it benefit you, the policyholder? Subrogation is important because any monies recovered through the subrogation process go directly to the insurance company’s bottom line. The benefits of subrogation have been demonstrated in company performance. This is according to the Ward Financial Group, a firm that researches property/casualty operations and identifies operational benchmarks that distinguish high performing companies. According to a study by Ward, companies that achieved superior operating results subrogated claims at about twice the rate of average companies and recovered substantially higher percentages of their loss payments through subrogation. A company with an effective subrogation department can offer lower premiums to their policyholders.For questions regarding your insurance needs, call us toll-free at 800-843-8550AMIS Disclaimer: The information in this article may be legally privileged.

D. BIERSDORFER JULY 12, 2016Microsoft’s Cortana assistant may use the Edge browser, but you can select a preferred program as your default app in the Windows 10 settings. The New York TimesQ. When I do voice searches with Cortana in Windows 10, it always uses the Edge browser and the Bing search engine. Can I set it to use Google Chrome and search?A. While workarounds like the Google Chrome Chrometana extension for redirecting Cortana-prompted Bing searches were once an easy option for using alternate software, Microsoft recently made changes to its software that broke Chrometana and restricted Cortana to using only Edge and Bing. (Programmers with a dislike of Bing and Edge immediately began to look for new solutions and you may find tools online to help get around Microsoft’s block, but download workaround programs and fiddle with your settings at your own risk.)Cortana may have her loyalties, but you can still set Google Chrome as your default program for web browsing in Windows 10 if you do not like Microsoft Edge and Bing search. To set Chrome as your default browser, go to the Start Menu, open Settings and select System. In the System box, choose Default Apps, scroll down to the Web Browser area, tap the Edge icon and choose Chrome from the menu.If you have not done so already, you can set Google as your default search engine in the Chrome settings. Although the hands-free command “O.K., Google” no longer works on the desktop version of Chrome, you can click or tap the microphone in the search box on the company’s home page and then give your spoken-word search request to Google. For some searches, like a check of the weather forecast, Google provides the answer audibly.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology totechtip@nytimes.com.

What is a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) and how is it performed?The lumbar puncture is usually performed while you are lying on your side in a curled up fetal position but may sometimes be performed in a sitting position. It is important that you remain still during the procedure. Once you are in the correct position, your back is cleaned with an antiseptic and a local anesthetic is injected under the skin. When the area has become numb, a special needle is inserted through the skin, between two vertebrae, and into your spinal canal. An \"opening\" or initial pressure reading of the CSF is obtained. The health practitioner then collects a small amount of CSF in multiple sterile vials. A \"closing\" pressure is obtained, the needle is withdrawn, and a sterile dressing and pressure are applied to the puncture site. You will then be asked to lie quietly in a flat position, without lifting your head, for one or more hours to avoid a potential post-test headache.The lumbar puncture procedure usually takes less than half an hour. For most patients, it is a moderately uncomfortable procedure. The most common sensation is a feeling of pressure when the needle is introduced. Let your healthcare provider know if you experience a headache or any abnormal sensations, such as pain, numbness, or tingling in your legs, or pain at the puncture site.The lumbar puncture is performed low in the back, well below the end of the spinal cord. There are spinal nerves in the location sampled, but they have room to move away from the needle. There is the potential for the needle to contact a small vein on the way in. This can cause a \"traumatic tap,\" which just means that a small amount of blood may leak into one or more of the samples collected. While this is not ideal, it may happen a certain percentage of the time. The evaluation of your results will take this into account.^ Back to top2. Are there other reasons to do a lumbar puncture?Yes. Sometimes it will be performed to introduce anesthetics or medications into the CSF. Repeated punctures are sometimes used to decrease CSF pressure.^ Back to top3. Why do I need a spinal tap? Why can't my blood or urine be tested?Spinal fluid, obtained during a spinal tap, is often the best sample to use for conditions affecting your central nervous system because your CSF surrounds your brain and spinal cord. Changes in the elements of your CSF due to central nervous system diseases or other serious conditions are often first and most easily detected in a sample of your spinal fluid. Tests on blood and urine may be used in conjunction with CSF analysis to evaluate your condition.^ Back to top4. What other tests may be done in addition to CSF analysis?Other laboratory tests that may be ordered along with or following CSF testing include:• Blood culture to detect and identify bacteria in the blood• Cultures of other parts of the body to detect the source of the infection that led to meningitis or encephalitis• Blood glucose, total protein to compare with the concentration of CSF glucose and protein• CBC (complete blood count) to evaluate cell counts in blood• Antibodies for a variety of viruses, such as West Nile Virus• ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein), for indication of inflammation• CMP (comprehensive metabolic panel), a group of tests used to evaluate electrolyte balance and organ function^ Back to top  \n",

At age 8, your child will likely have developed some interests and hobbies and will know what he or she likes or doesn't like.At the same time, children this age are learning more about the world at large and are also better able to navigate social relationships with others more independently, with less guidance from parents. At home, 8-year-olds are able to tackle more complicated household chores and take on more responsibility for taking care of themselves, even helping out with younger siblings.In general, according to the CDC, these are some changes you may see in your child:Shows more independence from parents and family.Starts to think about the future.Understands more about his or her place in the world.Pays more attention to friendships and teamwork.Wants to be liked and accepted by friends.1 Behavior and Daily RoutinesFabrice LeRouge/Getty ImagesThe 8-year-old's behavior and daily routines are shaped by the child's taste, interests, and personality. Parents and other significant adults in the child's life should keep in mind the importance of being good role models since this is a time when children are figuring out the world and who they are and how they fit into it. At this age, your child may get involved with more complex social activities and behaviors that help define his or her sense of self.Effective discipline techniques at this age include continuing to praise good behavior, focusing your child's efforts, what they can do and change, rather than innate traits (such as \"\"you are smart\"\"). Set up and enforce consistent rules. Discipline should be aimed at guiding your child rather than punishing. Follow it with a discussion with your child about what she could do differently next time.Your 8-year-old can do more self-care in regards to hygiene and may begin to want to be part of deciding what the family eats. You might begin to give your child chores to contribute to the maintenance of the household and an allowance to begin to learn to manage money. At this age, your child still needs 10 to 11 hours of sleep per night.2 Physical DevelopmentImage Source/Getty ImagesFor 8-year-old children, physical development will continue to be more about refinement of skills, coordination, and muscle control rather than huge changes. They begin to look like \"\"big kids,\"\" but puberty is still a couple of years away for most of them.Children with natural athletic potential may show their abilities at this developmental stage as their physical skills become more precise and accurate. In fact, this is often the age at which children decide whether they are athletic or not, and choose to participate in or avoid sports. Either way, it's important for parents to encourage physical activity. Even if your child isn't an athlete she can still enjoy running, swimming, biking, and many other types of non-sports-related physical fun.3 Emotional DevelopmentJohn Howard/Getty ImagesEight-year-old emotional development may be growing at a deeper level than in younger years, and an 8-year-old may show more sophisticated and complex emotions and interactions. For instance, an 8-year-old may mask true thoughts or emotions to spare someone else's feelings or work through a problem without an adult's close supervision or intervention.This is the time when your child may be developing a more sophisticated sense of himself in the world. Her interests, talents, friends, and relationship with family all help her to establish a clear self-identity. It's also the beginning of desiring privacy and flip-flopping between self-confidence and self-doubt.It can be a good time to help your child develop patience and empathy for others.4 Cognitive DevelopmentTom Merton/Getty ImagesEight-year-old children are at a stage of intellectual development where they will be able to pay attention for longer periods of time. You can expect your child to be able to concentrate on an activity for up to an hour or more. Eight-year-olds will also be able to think more critically and express opinions using more complex and sophisticated vocabulary and language skills.5 Social DevelopmentChristopher Futcher/Getty ImagesThis is the phase of social development where many children love being a part of sports teams and other social groups. In general, 8-year-old children enjoy school and will count on and value relationships with a few close friends and classmates. Parents of 8-year-olds should be on the lookout for problems such as school refusal, as this may indicate learning difficulties or being bullied at school. It is also a good age at which to discuss respecting others.6 What If My Child Is Different?Developmental milestones provide professionals and parents with a tool for comparing children to a norm. No child fits the ideal norm perfectly, and each child will have his or her personal quirks, strengths, challenges, and preferences. With that said, however, if you feel your child is far behind or ahead of the norm, it's well worth discussing the issue with your pediatrician and your child's teacher. If there are issues or opportunities, now is the time to learn about and address them.A Word From VerywellYour 8-year-old is in the full bloom of childhood. Enjoy activities and explore the world together. It's a great time to spark new interests in your child and watch her grow in every way.Sources:Anthony, Michelle.

With excellent personal hygiene, you will be able to carry yourself well anywhere at any given time. It will also show that you take good care of yourself.Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need helpAdEverything About Head Lice, Eggs, and NitsEven if you have excellent hygiene, ectoparasites such as lice, can strike. Most often, your child brings it home from school. If you become afflicted with such parasites, you must act quickly and make sure you are thorough in your efforts to get rid of them.Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need helpLice are wingless and very tiny. They infest your scalp and other body areas such as the pubic and armpit regions. Adult lice lay eggs. When the eggs hatch, they leave shells behind. These shells are called nits. When you see these nits on your scalp or on any area of the body, it is a neon sign of a lice infestation. You should know how to check for lice nits if you want to have a parasite-free body and scalp. It will definitely make you more confident when mingling with other people. Yes, it may be tedious and laborious, but this will help ensure a healthier lifestyle.Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need helpA Basic Description of LiceRecognize lice. You should definitely know how to recognize lice. These are wingless, tiny arthropods (six-legged invertebrates) that reside on your scalp. Lice are ectoparasites that rely on your blood to survive. They are about the size of a sesame seed. Lice are like mosquitoes, but instead of flying, they do best with crawling. You can get lice by being in direct contact with someone infested with head lice. Another way would be to share items such as headbands, clips, combs, or hats.Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need helpEggsThe female head lice lay eggs. These eggs are almost invisible to the naked eye because they're tiny and they blend into the color of your hair. Female head lice usually lay their eggs on the hair shafts near the hair roots. They attach with an adhesive that's naturally waterproof. That is why they cannot be blown or washed away.Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need helpBy the time the head lice eggs hatch, they leave empty eggshells behind. These are called nits. You could confuse nits with hairspray flakes, sand, or dandruff. Like the lice eggs, nits still have their adhesives so they cannot be removed that easily. Nits differ in coloration (brownish yellow, white). As the hair grows, the attached nits are found away from the roots. Since nits are indications of lice infestation, many schools do not admit children who have them. It is important for parents to check their children's heads for nits and eggs on a regular basis so that lice treatment could be performed immediately. Removing nits and lice eggs takes patience and a fine-toothed comb.Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need helpLife Cycle of Head LiceHead lice have three phases in their life cycle (40-50 days):1 Egg phase. The mature female lays eggs that are coated with an adhesive. This adhesive is effective for attaching the eggs to the hair shafts near the hair roots. The newly hatched head lice will hatch after 10 days. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Nymph phase. A nymph comes out of the head lice egg. They are not that easy to see. Nymphs cannot reproduce yet because they don't have a fully developed reproductive system yet. It takes 12 days for lice nymphs to mature. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Adult phase. This is the phase where the nymphs are finally mature enough to produce and lay eggs. Once they are sexually mature, they can lay four to 10 eggs every day. The life of adult head lice lasts about 28 days. Don't panic, but about 280 lice eggs could be laid by one mature female before she dies. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need helpHow to Check for Head Lice, Nits, and EggsYou can tell if there is a head lice infestation when the suspected host itches all the time. Oftentimes, children scratch their heads, nape, or behind the ears. Red bumps or small wounds might also be present in these areas. Once you notice itching or bumps, immediately check your child's head. There could already be a head lice outbreak in their school. You can check for head lice, nits, and eggs by using the following steps:Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need helpFirst Check For Lice1 Choose a relaxing place. Select a comfortable area for head lice checking. You should position your child seated in front of you. This will allow you to check all over your child's head conveniently. Do not do this on furniture that's upholstered, as lice may end up there. Go for a kitchen chair instead...you might even want to do this on the back deck. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Make sure there is natural light. It should be bright enough so you could detect the nits. The tiny adult lice do move quickly so you have to have appropriate lighting to see them. Head lice eggs are translucent. Moving the light around or moving under the light helps pinpoint them. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Fully examine the scalp. Part areas of hair and look closely at the scalp, the area behind the ears, and the nape. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need helpThe Wet Hair TechniqueDetecting head lice, eggs, and nits can be done by combing the hair with a fine-toothed comb. This method takes 5-15 minutes, depending on the thickness and the length of the hair. This can also be used as part of the treatment.Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help1 Wash the hair with regular shampoo.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Rinse the hair thoroughly and apply regular conditioner. Use three times the amount you usually use and do not rinse it out of the hair. This makes it really easy to comb. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Use a regular comb to remove tangles.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help4 Get a fine-toothed comb or a detection comb. There are detection combs that come with or without prescriptions, available at any drug store. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help5 Comb the hair using the detection comb. Make sure that it touches the scalp and reaches the tips of the hair. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help6 Work the entire head.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help7 Look at the comb and check for lice, nits, and eggs.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help8 If there are lice, nits, or eggs in the comb, wash it thoroughly first before running it through the hair again.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help9 Continue this process over the entire head.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help10 Rinse off the conditioner .Repeat the combing process to make sure every area is dealt with.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need helpDry Hair TechniqueThis only takes about 3-5 minutes, depending on the hair's thickness. This is not effective for treating lice, only detecting it.1 Use an ordinary comb to untangle and straighten dry hair.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Use the detection comb as soon as the tangles are removed.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Start combing from the hair base to the hair tips. Do this about three to four times before combing the next area. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help4 Examine the detection comb for lice, nits, and eggs.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help5 If there are any lice, nits or eggs in the comb, rinse the comb and dry it thoroughly before using it again.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help6 Perform the process until every portion of the hair is cleared.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need helpSymptoms of Pubic LicePubic lice can also be acquired. This is spread through sexual intercourse. If a sexual partner detects pubic lice infestation in his or her own pubic area, both sexual partners should be treated to avoid spreading the parasites again. Pubic lice are usually grey or brown. They can be acquired from infested clothes, bedding, and towels. Pubic lice look like tiny crabs and that's why they are also known as \"\"crabs\"\". These are the symptoms you have to watch out for:Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help1 Grey dots or brown dots present on the skin near or on the pubic area.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Intense level of itching.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 White eggs on the pubic hair shafts, very close to the roots.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help4 Pubic lice can also be present on the hair shafts of hair that grow on your underarms, trunk, and thighs. They could even be present in mustaches and beards. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need helpTreatment of Pubic Lice1 Use special lice shampoos that are formulated to kill pubic lice. These shampoos work on dry pubic hair. Just be careful not to let the shampoo get in contact with mucus areas such as the anus or the vagina. The shampoo could burn or irritate the mucus areas. Leave the shampoo for on to 10 minutes. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Pour on enough warm water to lather the shampoo up.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Rinse the area thoroughly.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help4 If the patient has a hairy pubic area, a detection comb should be used to check for head lice, nits, and eggs.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help5 Rinse thoroughly.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help6 Wash all clothes, sheets, undergarments, and towels using warm water for 20 minutes. This will ensure the death of the crabs. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help7 Perform another treatment after seven to 10 days of the first treatment to get rid of the newly hatched pubic lice.Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help8 You might want to consider shaving the public hair to the skin, but don't do it anytime near the special shampoo. You really don't want that stuff absorbing into your skin. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need helpSymptoms of Body LiceBody lice move to your skin to feed and then return to the seams of your clothes. They lay their eggs in the seams. Home lice sprays can be used to kill the adult lice, nits, and eggs. Spray them on non-washable objects, vehicle interiors, furniture, and mattresses.Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need helpTreatment for Body LiceAfter ridding your body of lice, wash all linens, coats, scarves, hats (washable ones), towels, and garments using hot water. Use high heat in drying them for about 20 minutes. If the items are non-washable, have them dry-cleaned.Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need helpPersonal hygiene is important and checking for lice nits is a very significant part of it. Be vigilant in preventing this infestation so that you could have a lice-free, healthy lifestyle.Alternative Method For Removing Lice Without Harsh ChemicalsThis is an effective way to remove lice and nits from your child's hair, without the use of any dangerous chemicals. If you've got longer hair, tie it up while you're doing this process...just to be safer.Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need helpWhat You'll NeedConditioner.

      "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/business/global/05tower.html\tDubai Opens a Tower to Beat All\tGlobal BusinessDubai Opens a Tower to Beat AllBy LANDON THOMAS Jr. JAN. 4, 2010A visitor gets a view of Dubai from the 124th floor of Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building, on Monday. Ali Haider/European Pressphoto AgencyBurdened by debt and a devastating real estate crash, Dubai is doing what it does best: doubling down.Just one month after a close brush with bankruptcy, Dubai celebrated the opening of the world’s tallest building on Monday — a rocket-shaped edifice that soars 2,717 feet and has views that reach 60 miles.The glittering celebration may have been an attempt by Dubai’s ruler, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, to shift the focus from Dubai’s current economic troubles to a future filled with more promise.All the same, the tower’s success by no means signals a recovery in Dubai’s beaten-down real estate market, where prices have collapsed by as much as 50 percent and many developers are having trouble finding occupants for their buildings.With its mix of nightclubs, mosques, luxury suites and boardrooms, the Burj is an almost perfect representation of Dubai’s own complexities and contradictions. It will have the world’s first Armani hotel; the world’s highest swimming pool, on the 76th floor; the highest observation deck, on the 124th floor; and the highest mosque, on the 158th floor.Related CoverageThe World’s Tallest Building JAN. 4, 2010Fireworks Greet Tallest SkyscraperBut in deciding to change the tower’s name from Burj Dubai to Burj Khalifa, in honor of the president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Dubai revealed a rare streak of humility consistent with its diminished economic condition. Once the most proudly autonomous of Arab Emirates, Dubai has found that its financial troubles have made it more dependent on Abu Dhabi and more likely to be drawn closer into the federation.“Dubai not only has the world’s tallest building, but has also made what looks like the most expensive naming rights deal in history,” said Jim Krane, the author of “City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism.” “Renaming the Burj Dubai after Sheik Khalifa of Abu Dhabi — if not an explicit quid pro quo — is a down payment on Dubai’s gratitude for its neighbor’s $10 billion bailout last month.”The opening festivities had the feel of a national holiday, with fireworks, parachute jumps and shooting streams of water from the world’s tallest fountain.At a cost estimated at $1.5 billion, the Burj took five years to build, is more than 160 floors high and has comfortably surpassed the previous record holder in Taiwan, the Taipei 101.More than 12,000 people will occupy its six million square feet, zooming up and down in 54 elevators that can reach speeds of 40 miles an hour. It was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in Chicago.At a time when several of Dubai’s newly built office towers stand empty, it is 90 percent sold, according to the building’s developer, Emaar Properties.To be sure, some have questioned the utility of such a towering project. At least three foreign workers died during the construction. And at a time of increasing concerns over global terrorism, such a building could pose an inviting target.The Burj Khalifa was named in honor of the president of Abu Dhabi.Charles Crowell/Bloomberg NewsBut to Dubai, which from its very beginning has taken pleasure in proving its doubters wrong, the Burj is evidence that if you build it big and brash enough the people will come, from near and far.With its strong government backing and unquestioned prestige, the Burj was a project that was destined to succeed and its developer, Emaar, had little difficulty in attracting residents — particularly since much of the space was sold several years ago in the middle of Dubai’s real estate frenzy.Other projects, however, have not been so lucky. One is the Omniyat Bayswater, a 24-story office building that stands less than half a mile from the Burj. It opened six months ago and remains more than 50 percent vacant.Sign up for the all-new DealBook newsletterOur columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.Sign UpYou agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.See Sample Privacy PolicyOpt out or contact us anytimeAimed to be the flagship structure of an ambitious development project in an area by the sea called Business Bay, Omniyat Bayswater has been unable to attract tenants as a consequence of the current real estate crisis.But its struggle speaks to a larger truth behind the Dubai real estate bubble which, despite the excitement over the Burj, could well forestall a meaningful recovery.Like many office projects developed four or five years ago, the peak years of Dubai’s expansion, the Omniyat Bayswater is plagued by splintered ownership. It is estimated to have more than 50 landlords — more than two per floor — with some trying to lease office suites as small as 1,000 square feet.A spokesman for Omniyat said that the developer recognized the problem of multiple owners, and had taken steps to address it and expected to see whole floors leased by the second quarter of this year.At a time when selling real estate was like handing out candy to children, the development model of selling to many owners, known as strata title, became a quick and easy way to finance building projects. Speculators from around the world were clamoring for the smallest slice of Dubai property.But with the crash, the building’s ownership structure has made it extremely difficult to sell or lease a floor or two to foreign companies seeking to expand.“There has been a difficulty in creating a collective of owners,” said Nick Maclean of the real estate firm CB Richard Ellis in Dubai. “The majority of the building is empty.”Few offers have been made for space in buildings under strata title, which is estimated to cover about two-thirds of the new buildings opening this year and 70 percent of those opening in 2011. Without government action, office vacancy rates could rise as high as 40 percent, according to real estate analysts.As for the effect the Burj will have on the overall market, Mr. Maclean said that its opening, while heartening, was unlikely to prompt an immediate turn around in the market.“It is a unique building and symbolically important but it is not going to stimulate demand,” he said.Correction: January 7, 2010An article on Tuesday about the opening of the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, misstated the position of Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, for whom the tower is named. He is president of the United Arab Emirates, not of Abu Dhabi. (He is emir of Abu Dhabi.) The error also appeared in a picture caption accompanying the article and was repeated in an editorial on Wednesday. The editorial also misstated the beneficiary of a $10 billion loan from Abu Dhabi. It was the emirate of Dubai, not the United Arab Emirates.A version of this article appears in print on January 5, 2010, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Dubai Opens A Tower To Beat All.

Weeds are never completely eradicated because their seeds fall into the soil and remain viable. By taking the time to remove the weeds, you will keep the other vegetation safe. Some steps will help you keep many of the weeds from coming back into the garden.Things You'll NeedGardening glovesPre-emergent herbicideSelective herbicide or post-emergent herbicideMulchNewspaperPull the weeds by hand. Put on some gardening gloves and grasp the weed as close to the soil line as possible. Give a quick pull and the weed should come out of the ground--roots and all. It the weeds do not pull easily, or if they break off at the stem, water the area first.Apply a pre-emergent herbicide to the soil. It will kill weeds--but not your flowers or other grasses--before the weeds begin to grow. This type of herbicide prevents the weed seeds from germinating and is safe to use around plants. Apply according to label directions.Spray the area with a selective herbicide or a post-emergent herbicide designed to kill weeds but not grass and flowers. Read and follow label directions for application and amounts, as they can vary. Ask the clerk at the garden center for the correct herbicide.Lay down a 2- to 4-inch layer of mulch, if possible. If you have a lot of space between plants, place 12 sheets of newspaper over the soil between plants. Cover the newspaper with mulch and the water it down to keep the newspaper on the ground when wind blows.\n",
      "http://vanrcook.tripod.com/presidentroosevelt.htm\tPresident Roosevelt Led US To Victory In World War 2\t\"In World War 2, the three great Allied leaders against Germany were President Roosevelt , Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union. Three finer war leaders could not have been found at any time in history. Churchill, a leader with bulldog tenacity and possessing fine oratorical skills, Stalin, the man of steel, and Roosevelt, the great politician and compromisor, held the allies together when things looked blackest and then led them to victory over the fanatical resistance of the Germans and Japanese.On the other side of the war, Hitler, although an evil person, also had his moments of leadership particularly at the start of the war. But none of the other Axis leaders (certainly not Mussolini!) were of the caliber of the three Allied leaders. Hitler was outnumbered three to one when it came to leadership.This web site deals with President Roosevelt during World War 2. He had followed Herbert Hoover as president in 1933 shortly after the Great Depression began and served as president until 1945 when he died in office just as World War 2 was ending. Vice-President Harry Truman succeeded Roosevelt as president and led America in the immediate post-World War 2 era as the cold war began.FDR's close ties to Winston Churchill are discussed on this web site. `\"\" The only thing we have to fear is fear itself .\"\"President Roosevelt.Roosevelt was one of America's greatest presidents. To me, he has always been the perfect example of what an American president should be. Depending on the crisis at hand, Roosevelt undertook whatever corrective steps he thought needed to be taken. A child of the upper class, he, nevertheless, felt it was his duty to help those less fortunate than himself and he initiated the New Deal.The president's wife (and fifth cousin), Eleanor Roosevelt, also had strong feelings in that direction and encouraged FDR in his efforts. Although he often had to compromise with his rich and powerful friends, he was a true champion of the \"\"forgotten man.\"\"President Roosevelt was conscious of the power of the presidency and used it as no one ever had before. He worked his way through two major crises in his 4 terms as president: the Great Depression and World War 2.U.S. Unprepared at Beginning of World War 2. After Czechoslovakia fell to Germany in 1938, Roosevelt felt sure that Europe would erupt into war and that the U.S. would be drawn in. He knew the British and French were our natural allies and that Germany was wrong in its forced acquisition of surrounding nations. Even though he knew which side we must support, he could make no overt maneuvers because this country, including Congress, was militantly isolationist at the time. There was opposition to war from both the right and the left.The right wingers were particularly adamant in their opposition. Some even wanted to join Hitler and the Nazis and attack Russia to clean out the communists who they thought were the \"\"real\"\" enemy (worse than Hitler!? The right-wingers were a little out of touch with reality).So, even though President Roosevelt watched country after country fall into Nazi Germany's hands in 1939, 1940 and 1941, he was unable to attempt a rescue because American public support was not there.United States Prepares For WarAll in all, the United States was lightly armed in 1938. The Navy was adequate but the army was woefully small. Roosevelt had to get the country ready for war he knew was probably coming but in such a manner as to not upset the isolationists. He had to move slowly: He did a wonderful job in this effort.1. In November of 1938, President Roosevelt startled his military advisers by advocating the production of 10,000 military aircraft by 1940 and providing the capacity to produce 10,000 planes per year thereafter. This advice did not set well with some advisors who wanted a more balanced approach. But Roosevelt was trying to let Hitler know what America could produce if aroused. He was hoping to discourage Hitler's aggression.2. In July of 1939, Roosevelt issued a military order moving agencies related to defense to report directly to the President and not to the various official government department heads. This created some confusion since the department heads were often left out of matters. However, the order provided a personal relationship between the president and the military chiefs. This is the way Roosevelt liked to work. It also magnified the power of the military chiefs which was a good thing as the nation prepared for war.3. In September of 1940, Roosevelt made a destroyer deal with Great Britain providing them with 50 World War I destroyers in return for a string of bases in the Caribbean.4. In September of 1940, the Selective Service Act was passed and Americans began to be drafted.5. In early 1941, President Roosevelt had Congress pass the \"\"Lend-Lease Act\"\" which provided Britain and Russia with arms via lease but with no conditions for repayment. As the president said, \"\"When your neighbor's house is on fire, one does not haggle over the price to put it out, the hose is readily loaned and the price is figured later.\"\"America was slowly getting ready for war!U.S. Enters World War 2.On December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and, on December 11th, Germany declared war on the U.S. (A big mistake by Hitler - otherwise, we might have concentrated on beating Japan first). America was now in World War 2! Americans were no longer isolationists - they were mad as hell and they were not going to take it! Overseas, Churchill, despite the disaster, could not help but feel a great relief (actually he was ecstatic) that America was now in the war. He later wrote,\"\"No American will think it wrong of me if I proclaim that to have the United States at our side was to me the greatest joy.............but now at this very moment I knew the United States was in the war, up to the neck and in to the death. So we had won after all! Yes, after Dunkerque; after the fall of France; .......after the threat of invasion......after seventeen months of lonely fighting.........We had won the war. England would live;.........Our history would not come to an end....Hitler's fate was sealed.........there was no more doubt about the end.\"\"Churchill could relax for a moment after standing up to the Nazis, virtually alone, for two years. In retrospect, Churchill's optimistic outlook only partly came true. The Allies won the war all right and both Germany and Japan were defeated. But the British Empire was doomed as the nations who made up the commonwealth began to fly the coop after the war and, finally, Britain was the only significant power left. Although Bitain ended up on the winning side, the empire was finished as were other empires, e.g., German, Italian, French, and Japanese empires.Roosevelt - Churchill Relationship During World War 2.Just prior to the start of World War 2 in September 1939, President Roosevelt had written Churchill (Churchill was not yet prime minister) and the two opened a correspondence and began a warm friendship that would last until Roosevelt's death in 1945 although problems began to occur near the end because of Roosevelt's hesitancy in joining Churchill in moving to limit Soviet Union expansionism. This close relationship between the two leaders, of course, spilled over into the relationship between the countries. It led to the creation of the Combined Chiefs of Staff which was a joint military command over all British-American operations. It also led to the development of a second front in France, development of an atomic bomb, creation of the United Nations, and final defeat of the axis powers.President Roosevelt as Commander-in Chief During World War 2.Prior to the war and for the first year or so of World War 2, President Roosevelt functioned as the \"\"real\"\" Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. armed forces. This is an authority that all presidents have a constitutional right to exercise but few do. Roosevelt was personally involved in all major decisions. One reason for this is that the enemy had the initiative early on and America was developing a strategy to counter the assault and seize the initiative. Alternative methods of conducting the war had to be considered and the president had to decide which way to go. (See Planning & Strategy for more on strategy.)Once the war had gone on for awhile, the tide had turned, America and its allies had the initiative, and a master plan had been developed, so there was no need for President Roosevelt to be so heavily involved. Also, as the war proceeded, the military command system became too large for the personal control Roosevelt liked to exercise. Now he had to depend on theater commanders, the planning staffs, etc. He still used the personal touch with Churchill and his top military advisors but he could no longer control events as he did in pre-war days. This was true of strategy development and in operational planning. Roosevelt was not above stepping in on certain occasions but, essentially, control of military details had shifted to others closer to the action.President Roosevelt still maintained close contact with events through his top assistants - Harry Hopkins and Admiral William Leahy - whom he relied heavily on in making wartime decisions. Early in the conflict, Roosevelt relied more on Hopkins than his military chiefs, however, this changed as the war went on. For his part, Leahy served as a liaison officer or, as Roosevelt called him, \"\"a sort of leg man,\"\" transmitting information between the President and the Joint Chiefs. Leahy was a perfect man for the job due to his military seniority, personal friendship with the President, and personality. Largely due to his efforts, the views of the President and the military chiefs never drifted far apart as had occasionally happened early in the war.Roosevelt as Commander-in-Chief - Operation TORCH. Early in the war in 1942, Roosevelt was still acting as the \"\"real\"\" Commander-in-Chief and moved forcibly on a critical strategic decision.A joint American - British decision for a cross-channel invasion of France in 1943 (Operation OVERLORD) had been made early on. The plan had been endorsed enthusiastically by the Americans and reluctantly by the British. As time went by, the two sides began squabbling over whether the invasion of France should actually be made in 1943 or delayed until 1944. The American military chiefs even went so far as to recommend that, if the British did not go along with the U.S. invasion plan, the Americans should drop the prevailing Europe-first strategy and begin to move forces to the Pacific theater. In July 1942, Roosevelt intervened strongly in the dispute. He said he would not allow any diversion of forces from Europe to the Pacific. In effect, the British approach won out because of the president's intervention. Instead of an invasion of Europe in 1943, a much less aggressive landing of forces was made in North Africa (Operation TORCH) in late 1942. This substitute action for the now-delayed Operation OVERLORD held the British - American coalition together and the Europe-first strategy was preserved. In retrospect, the decision to delay was probably the correct one because we really were not fully ready for an invasion in 1943. Casualties would have been immense, and indeed, the invasion might have failed.It should be noted that Stalin became infuriated with the postponement of Operation OVERLORD. He was in favor of a second front as early as possible to take pressure off his country. The Russians were already taking immense casualties - they were not that concerned that others might have to share taking casualties with them.Roosevelt Contrasted to Churchill as Leaders During World War 2. Roosevelt's usual hands-off approach as Commander-in-Chief was unlike his restless friend Churchill's approach. Churchill could not refrain from meddling with the British commanders in the matters of tactics and strategy. It should be noted here that, for all his greatness, Churchill's meddling did not always have a happy ending as he often wanted to move the allied thrusts to obscure (e.g., invade the \"\"soft underbelly of Europe\"\") theaters away from the primary theater. At these times, he sometimes seemed to act as a child playing with his toys. He had had the same problem in World War I when he initiated the doomed attack on Galipoli, Turkey, a disaster which cost him his position. He was almost - but not quiet - as bad a meddler with the military leaders as Hitler was on the German side.Roosevelt and Churchill had much different personalities. Roosevelt was a very political man, a man who used his charm, a compromisor, and a man who tried to avoid any controversy. His approach was always the indirect approach. (Had Roosevelt been a military man, he would have followed the \"\"indirect approach\"\" of Liddell Hart.) And by no means was Roosevelt an open man. He did not easily reveal his reasons for making decisions so his subordinates constantly had to try to read his mind and it did not appear to bother him at all to keep them guessing. The Bronx political leader, Edward Flynn, once observed of Roosevelt, \"\"Roosevelt would adopt ideas only if he believed in them. If he disagreed, he simply did nothing.\"\"Churchill, on the other hand, had a very opposite personality. His was the direct approach. He loved controversy and debate. He presented his ideas openly and loudly with much documentation and with great fervor. His associates and critics alike were allowed to do the same. He was an 'open read'. You always knew where Churchill stood on an issue. Because of his pugnacious disposition, Churchill was always getting knocked about by someone and had often, in his career, lost whatever job he might have at the time. But he had great tenacity and always got back on his feet full of fight.Such different men!.... but together, they made a great team. They, along with Stalin, ran World War and won it.The World War 2 Conferences. A number of conferences were held between Roosevelt and Churchill during World War 2. The Casablanca Conference between Roosevelt and Churchill was one of the more important conferences. A decision was made at this conference that no peace would be concluded with the Axis except on the basis of \"\"unconditional surrender.\"\" This was done partly to placate the always suspicious Soviets that America and Britain would not seek a separate peace with Germany leaving the Soviets \"\"holding the bag.\"\" Some critics say that this action unnecessarily lengthened World War 2 and caused unnecessary casualties. Politically, though, it was probably necessary.Two of the last conferences were held at Teheran and Yalta and included Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin. Here the long range objectives of the United States and Britain began to deviate and some strain began to show on the friendship of Roosevelt and Churchill.Churchill had been looking ahead to the post-World War 2 period and had perceived that the Soviet Union was going to be a problem with its expansive goals and its communistic ideology.Roosevelt was less concerned about the Russians. He was more concerned about America getting caught up in the rebuilding of Europe and the possibility that they might have to station troops there indefinitely. He apparently felt that Americans would revert to their isolationists ways after the war and he had to get the country out of Europe as soon as possible. He also accepted the idea that Russia would have an expanded role in Europe after the war. Critics have long criticized Roosevelt in this aspect of his policy. To some, he sold out to the Soviets. To others, he was so anxious to end the war fast and get out of Europe that he ignored long-range political aspects which make up so large a part of war.There is no doubt that the rapidly deteriorating health of President Roosevelt's health affected his performance during the last months of his life and contributed to his weakness regarding the Russians during the last two conferences.President Roosevelt's Death.President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, a little over two weeks before the death of Hitler and a month before Germany surrendered and the European part of World War 2 ended. After his death, Churchill wrote Eleanor: \"\"I have lost a dear and cherished friendship which was forged in the fire of war.\"\"Overall, Roosevelt was a wonderful leader for America. He pulled us through both the great depression of the 30s and the World War 2. He made his share of mistakes. For example, there is no doubt that he waffled on the Jewish problem even as news of German atrocities toward the Jews began to be publicized. However, when you look at how the other American leaders have handled different crisis in the twentieth century, he was, in my opinion, clearly superior to all the others.Web Sites: President Roosevelt In World War 2.1.

      "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-4-best-strategies-for-dealing-with-customer-service-2014-08-14\tThe 4 best strategies for dealing with customer service\tShutterstock.com / wavebreakmediaIf you want your cable company, airline or pretty much any other company to resolve your complaints quickly and completely, you may need to change the way you deal with customer service.According to the latest data from the American Customer Service Index, Americans are increasingly dissatisfied with the companies they deal with. In the first quarter of 2014, overall customer satisfaction scores across all industries fell to 76.2 out of 100, which the researchers who compile the ratings say was “one of the largest [drops] in the 20-year history of the Index.” And some industries are particularly hated: Internet (63 out of 100) and cable and subscription TV (65) companies and airlines (69) rank at the bottom when it comes to customer satisfaction.Part of the dissatisfaction may be because we are interacting with customer service the wrong way. A report released Wednesday by customer-service software firm Zendesk, which looked at customer-service interactions from more than 25,000 companies across 140 countries, as well as insight from customer-service experts, found that some consumers are acting in ways that aren’t yielding them good results.Here are four strategies to employ when dealing with customer service.Don’t be too sternBeing “overbearing” or “overly stern” is “a common strategy for some customers seeking better service,” the Zendesk survey revealed. “However, the data indicates that customers who are polite tend to submit higher customer satisfaction scores than those who aren’t.” Indeed, customers who ask the customer service rep to “please” help them with their request, and who said “thank you” for help they received throughout the call reported that they got better customer service than those who did not use these words, the survey showed.Of course, it could be that people who use these words tend to be more satisfied anyway. But there’s a strong chance that saying these platitudes ingratiates the customer service rep to you -- making them more willing to help you quickly and kindly with your request, experts say. “If you can find any excuse at all to praise them and build them up -- ‘you’re very good at what you do,’ ‘I really appreciate the extra effort,’ — people will almost always bend over backwards to maintain that good opinion and to show you just how good they really are,” says Barry Maher, the author of “Filling the Glass,” which focuses in part on getting better customer service and on personal empowerment. “Treat people well who aren’t used to being treated well…and you may well be astonished by the results you get.” Chip Bell, the founder of business consulting firm Chip Bell Group and author of “The 9 1/2 Principles of Innovative Service” adds that “you don’t have to be from the South to show respect with a liberal amount of ‘sir’ and ‘ma’am — it will open doors otherwise closed.”At the very least, “don’t go in guns a’ blazing,” says Shep Hyken, author of “Amaze Every Customer Every Time.” “The moment you lose your cool is the moment you lose control.” And, if that kindness does not work — rather than starting to get nasty — simply ask to speak to a higher authority, says Maher.Take notesTake a lesson from Rich Davis, the Comcast customer who recorded his call with the company and saw it go viral: It often pays to have good records of the antics a company is up to if you want to get your way down the road. “Have you ever heard a recording when you call for assistance that stated, ‘be advised this call may be recorded for quality assurance,’?” says motivational coach and speaker Chantay Bridges. “Flip the script, let the rep know: you are documenting them and keeping a record, that their service is also being noted.” While few customers keep detailed notes or recordings of their interactions, experts say, this will help them should there be a problem down the road, as they’ll have proof of what went on.Don’t keep your problems to yourselfMost customers know that they should contact customer service via multiple channels like phone, email and social media to get their complaint resolved ASAP. But few take the logical next step: contacting competitors via these channels too to explain how their current company is not serving their needs. “If you receive a response from a competitor, watch or ask for a counter from the business you originally were contacting,” says John Huehn, CEO of In the Chat, which provides social media and text messaging platforms to enhance customer service. This could provide you with the leverage you need to get your issue resolved.It’s OK to keep it briefWhen it comes to email complaints, longer isn’t better, so don’t waste your breath (you might, after all, need that energy for dealing with the company later on). While experts often advise consumers to give customer service reps as many details as possible so they can effectively fix the customer’s complaint, customers who wrote long emails didn’t report getting any better customer service than those who wrote short ones, the Zendesk survey revealed. Indeed, the customer’s satisfaction levels at the end of the exchange were roughly the same whether they wrote 50 words or 200 words. Jason Maynard, product manager and data science lead at Zendesk, says that this doesn’t mean you should not include detail (indeed, that helps) but that you should make this detail as succinct as possible; if you have a complicated problem or request, you may want to consider calling, as most of us aren’t trained as technical writers.\n",

      "http://www.boral.com.au/concrete/diy/step4-formwork.asp\tDIY Concrete Guide: Step 4 â Cut & Place Formwork\t\"What is \"\"Formwork\"\"?Formwork is the walls that support the concrete until its set. It forms a mould. The best material for formwork is timber at least 25mm thick and equal in width to the concrete thickness.Formwork for Concrete PathsUse structural plywood or hardboard.For curved paths, hardboard or 7mm plywood is suitable but requires more supporting pegs.Forms must be strong, smooth on the top edge and well supported with stout pegs. (A good test for the strength of formwork is its ability to withstand a reasonable kick).Formwork must be deep enough to hold the thickness of concrete placed and to prevent slurry escaping underneath.Plywood FormworkPlywood formwork from your local building supply or timber yard is easy to cut to shape and can be reused for several jobs. You can cut enough formwork from a standard 2440mm x 1220mm sheet to make a path 1 metre wide and about 10 metres long.Place the forms along the borders marked out with string.2) Secure forms in position with stout pegs driven into the ground inside and outside the forms.The outside pegs should be placed at more frequent intervals and the forms nailed to them.Hammer the pegs down to below the height of the forms.Coat the formwork lightly with thin oil or form oil to be removed easily later.Soak the ground and forms thoroughly with water - the night before the pour.Dampen again before the Boral Concrete truck arrives. The ground should be damp but not muddy.Place reinforcement (check if required)Areas like garage floors require reinforcing with mesh or similar. Local building regulations sometimes demand the use of reinforcement. For information on what types of mesh to use and how to cut and place it, contact one of the steel fabric mesh suppliers eg. Bluescope Steel.Check your measurementsOnce you’ve got the formwork sorted and a few other preparations are complete, do one final check on the quantity of concrete you require. IMPORTANT! Check the THICKNESS. Remember - if your slab has an average thickness of 10% more than your original measurements you will need at least 10% more concrete to complete your job. > Step 5 – Placing the Concrete> Back to DIY Concrete steps> Safety Advice\"\n",

      "https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/incontinence\tUrinary Incontinence\t\"At least 10 million Americans suffer from incontinence, which means that they are not able to control the times when they urinate. In some cases, the loss of urine is so small that people are hardly aware of it. In other cases, the amount of leakage is quite large. Only about 10 percent of people who suffer from incontinence seek treatment. Without treatment, many of these people stay at home and withdraw from life unnecessarily. Incontinence is not a disease, but it can be a symptom of disease.Is urinary incontinence caused by aging?Incontinence occurs in all age groups but is most common in the elderly. It is the most common reason for people going into nursing homes.Does pregnancy cause urinary incontinence?Pregnant women may have a small amount of urine leakage due to the pressure of the baby against the bladder and the muscles that support it. Usually, this leakage occurs when the woman coughs or sneezes. The problem generally goes away within three or four months after the baby is born. It is helpful if the woman does exercises, called Kegel exercises, to strengthen the muscles. Sometimes, women who have had children are more likely to develop incontinence when they get older due to weakening of the muscles that support the bladder. This is sometimes treated by medications, but surgery may be needed in some cases.Which diseases can cause incontinence?Diabetes, strokes and nerve diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. These diseases can damage the nerves that control the bladder which is where urine is stored before it leaves the body. These diseases can also weaken the \"\"sphincter,\"\" a ring of muscle around the opening of the bladder. This ring usually keeps urine from leaking out. Men can have incontinence from problems such as overgrowth of the prostate gland or cancer of the prostate gland, both of which can block the flow of urine. In these cases, urine leaks out when the bladder becomes too full.How can I tell if I have urinary incontinence?If you are having urine leakage, you should seek medical care to find out the cause. The doctor will ask you about your medical history and order laboratory tests. The doctor will also examine you. Sometimes, special tests may be done. In one of these, the bladder is filled with fluid. You will then be asked to repeat the action that usually causes you to have urine leakage, such as coughing or straining. X-rays and other measurements are then done to help the doctor find out why you are having the urine leakage.Are there any treatments?Yes. Urine leakage can often be stopped or lessened after the doctor finds the cause. Some treatments that have helped other people include drugs, behavioral therapy, special exercises, biofeedback, electrical stimulation and surgery.DRUGS: Several drugs are available for treating incontinence, depending on what is causing your problem. Some of these drugs, called \"\"bladder relaxants,\"\" prevent urine leakage by decreasing bladder contractions. Another type of drug helps some kinds of incontinence by strengthening muscle contractions at the outlet of the bladder. Estrogens also have been helpful for some women after menopause. A nasal spray that causes you to make less urine is also used for day and nighttime urine leakage (bed-wetting).BEHAVIORAL THERAPY: You can work with a specially trained therapist who will help you to control your urine leakage.EXERCISE: You can learn to do special exercises to strengthen the muscles that prevent leakage of urine from the bladder.BIOFEEDBACK: These techniques also help you to gain control over your bladder and to strengthen the sphincter muscle.ELECTRICAL STIMULATION: This method can help you to strengthen your sphincter muscle and keep your bladder from contracting when you do not want this to happen.SURGERY: Usually, your doctor will first try medical treatments such as drugs, biofeedback, etc. If these do not work, surgery may be planned. Some types of urinary incontinence due to weakness of the sphincter can be corrected by strengthening the muscle with surgery. A newer technique involves injecting collagen (a protein material) around the urethra to support and compress the sphincter muscle.What if these treatments do not work?These treatments should bring relief to most people who have urinary incontinence. However, if the treatments do not work for you, many absorbent protective pads are available to use. In men, a special sheath, known as a condom catheter, may be worn around the penis to drain the urine into a bag.Sometimes, a tube called an in-dwelling catheter may be placed into the bladder to drain urine continuously. This method can cause problems, such as infections, and should be used only in special cases as a permanent form of treatment. Another approach is to use a catheter several times a day to drain the bladder.Will incontinence prevent me from being active sexually?Not necessarily. Often, there is no physical reason why a person with incontinence cannot be sexually active. However, some of the diseases that cause incontinence, such as multiple sclerosis and diabetes, also may decrease the ability to perform sexually.\"\n",

Abnormal bleeding can also come from the uterus and other organs in the pelvis.During midlife, women’s hormone levels slowly decrease. This normal change can cause irregular bleeding. Usually this type of bleeding stops around the time a woman has her final period (menopause).Abnormal vaginal bleeding can also be caused by:Infection of the vagina or uterusUrinary tract infectionOther medical conditionsUterine fibroidsGrowths in the pelvic organs, including cancerAlso, some medications may affect vaginal bleeding.Call us to schedule an exam if you have vaginal bleeding that:Is heavier or lasts longer than usual.Occurs after you’ve completed menopause (12 months of no periods).Treatment is based on the cause of your vaginal bleeding. It may include medication, nonsurgical procedures, and surgery.CausesChanges in your bleeding patterns are normal during midlife stages.PerimenopausePerimenopause is the time period before your menstrual cycle ends. Usually it begins several years before menopause. For some women, it starts as early as their mid-30s or early 40s. There’s no way to tell how long perimenopause will last.You may be in perimenopause if your periods are:Irregular, with longer or shorter cycles (time between periods).Lighter or heavier than has been usual for you.Irregular periods occur when you’re no longer ovulating (releasing an egg) every month.MenopauseWhen you have not had a menstrual period for 12 months in a row, you’ve completed menopause.Menopause usually happens several years after you first have perimenopause symptoms.If you have vaginal bleeding after menopause, call us to schedule an exam.Symptoms and DiagnosisUnusual bleeding from the uterus that is not due to growths (fibroids or polyps) is called dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB).Bleeding can be heavy or light. During perimenopause, it’s usually due to natural changes, including:Changes in hormone levelsNo ovulation (anovulation)To find out what’s causing DUB, we may:Perform a pelvic exam.Do blood and urine tests.Check a tissue sample (biopsy).Related ConditionsAbnormal bleeding can also result from this range of medical conditions.Infections of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries can include:Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)Genital warts on the vulva or in the vaginaUrinary tract infection (UTI) can cause bleeding from the bladder. UTI or bladder infection symptoms include:Pink or light-brown urineBlood in the urinePain when urinatingFrequent need to urinateThyroid problems occur especially in women over 40.An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) can cause heavy and prolonged vaginal bleeding.An overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) can cause unusual bleeding.A noncancerous growth in the pituitary gland  (prolactinoma) can cause abnormal bleeding. The pituitary gland at the base of your brain produces hormones, including prolactin.Cushing’s syndrome is caused by a growth in the pituitary gland. It causes high levels of cortisol in the blood. Cortisol is a hormone that helps your body respond to stress.Vaginal dryness, a common symptom of menopause, can cause bleeding during sex with intercourse.Other CausesGrowths in one of the pelvic organs can cause unusual bleeding.Uterine fibroids are noncancerous growths in the wall of the uterus. Fibroids can be as small as a seed or as large as a grapefruit. They can grow as a single tumor or in several places.Women are most likely to have fibroids in midlife. Sometimes they occur in younger women.Fibroids may cause no symptoms. Or they may cause:Periods to occur more oftenMenstrual crampsBack painProblems with bowel movements or urinationPain during intercourseA cervical polyp is a small fingerlike growth on the cervix or in the uterus. We sometimes find cervical polyps during a pelvic exam. They are usually noncancerous (benign).Hormone-producing tumors are growths that can change your menstrual cycles. We diagnose such tumors using:Physical examBlood testsUltrasound examCancers of the uterus, cervix, and vagina are serious diseases. Be sure to be screened regularly by your doctor for these conditions.HemorrhoidsBleeding from hemorrhoids can be mistaken for vaginal bleeding. Hemorrhoids occur when the veins around your bottom (rectum and anus) swell and bleed.Hemorrhoids cause:ItchingPainA hard lump around the anusHemorrhoids usually go away within a few days. Let us know if you have a hemorrhoid that does not heal.Injury or traumaThe genital area may be injured and bleed during:SexTampon insertionStrenuous exerciseIf a tampon or other object is left in your vagina, it can cause irregular bleeding. We can check for these injuries by giving you a pelvic exam.Medications That May Affect BleedingMany medications can cause unusual vaginal bleeding. You might have:Lighter or heavier periodsLess or more frequent bleedingSkipped periodsMedications that can change your regular bleeding pattern include:Aspirin and other anticoagulant medicines (Coumadin)Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (ibuprofen)Birth control pillsBirth control injections (Depo-Provera)Contraceptive implants (Implanon)IUD (Mirena intrauterine device)Hormone therapyMedications for other conditions that can affect your bleeding patterns include:Psychiatric medications, such as antidepressantsSeizure medications (Dilantin)Corticosteroids (Prednisone)Medicines to prevent organ transplant rejectionChemotherapy for cancer (Cytoxan or tamoxifen)Radiation therapyThyroid medicines (Synthroid, Levothroid)If you think your menstrual bleeding changes may be related to medication, let us know.If the medication you’re taking has not been prescribed by a doctor, stop taking it and call us.Help for Partner AbuseUnfortunately, abusive relationships are common. Abuse can be physical, sexual, or psychological harm. It may include pressuring or forcing you to have sex or do things you are not comfortable with or refusing to use a condom to protect against pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).If this is happening to you, you can get help by talking to us, or you can:Contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 or 1-800-787-3224 for hearing/speech impaired or at www.thehotline.org.Visit the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673 or at www.rainn.org.Additional References:Abnormal Vaginal Bleeding in Midlife and Beyond: TreatmentsMenopauseMenopause and Irregular BleedingMenstruationCushing's SyndromeHyperparathyroidismPituitary Gland ConditionsBladder Problems and Infections (Urinary Tract Infections)FibroidsHemorrhoidsCervical Cancer Screening (Pap Test)Domestic ViolencePDF Link to Everyone Deserves a Safe RelationshipIf you have an emergency medical condition, call 911 or go to the nearest hospital.

      "http://www.amisinsurance.com/content/subrogation_information_article.php\tWhat is Subrogation and why is it important?\tSubrogation is the act of one party claiming the legal rights of another that it has reimbursed for losses. Subrogation occurs in property/casualty insurance when a company pays one of its insured’s for damages, then makes its own claim against others who may have caused the loss, insured the loss, or contributed to it.For Example: Suppose another driver runs a red light and your car is totaled. You have insurance on your car, so you call your insurance carrier and they pay you for all of your expenses related to the accident. Your insurance company, realizing that the other driver had an insurance policy, then seeks reimbursement from the at-fault party’s insurance carrier. Your insurer is “subrogated” to the rights of your policy and can “step in your shoes” to recover any amount paid out on your behalf. This is the definition of subrogation.Policy TypesSubrogation can apply to all different types of policies, personal and business related. Example :Suppose your child starts a fire at their school causing $6,000.00 in damages. The juvenile court orders you to pay for the damages to the school. You might have coverage for this incident under the negligent supervision clause of your homeowner’s insurance policy. You should contact them immediately to find out if coverage applies. What if you arrive at your business and discover it is destroyed by fire caused by a defective copier that you purchased. Your insurance company would pay the claim and then subrogate against the manufacturer of the copier to recover the expenses paid out. Most insurance companies would attempt to recover any out-of- pocket expense you might incur as well.Why it is important to youWhy is subrogation becoming so important in the insurance industry and how can it benefit you, the policyholder? Subrogation is important because any monies recovered through the subrogation process go directly to the insurance company’s bottom line. The benefits of subrogation have been demonstrated in company performance. This is according to the Ward Financial Group, a firm that researches property/casualty operations and identifies operational benchmarks that distinguish high performing companies. According to a study by Ward, companies that achieved superior operating results subrogated claims at about twice the rate of average companies and recovered substantially higher percentages of their loss payments through subrogation. A company with an effective subrogation department can offer lower premiums to their policyholders.For questions regarding your insurance needs, call us toll-free at 800-843-8550AMIS Disclaimer: The information in this article may be legally privileged.

D. BIERSDORFER JULY 12, 2016Microsoft’s Cortana assistant may use the Edge browser, but you can select a preferred program as your default app in the Windows 10 settings. The New York TimesQ. When I do voice searches with Cortana in Windows 10, it always uses the Edge browser and the Bing search engine. Can I set it to use Google Chrome and search?A. While workarounds like the Google Chrome Chrometana extension for redirecting Cortana-prompted Bing searches were once an easy option for using alternate software, Microsoft recently made changes to its software that broke Chrometana and restricted Cortana to using only Edge and Bing. (Programmers with a dislike of Bing and Edge immediately began to look for new solutions and you may find tools online to help get around Microsoft’s block, but download workaround programs and fiddle with your settings at your own risk.)Cortana may have her loyalties, but you can still set Google Chrome as your default program for web browsing in Windows 10 if you do not like Microsoft Edge and Bing search. To set Chrome as your default browser, go to the Start Menu, open Settings and select System. In the System box, choose Default Apps, scroll down to the Web Browser area, tap the Edge icon and choose Chrome from the menu.If you have not done so already, you can set Google as your default search engine in the Chrome settings. Although the hands-free command “O.K., Google” no longer works on the desktop version of Chrome, you can click or tap the microphone in the search box on the company’s home page and then give your spoken-word search request to Google.

Why can't my blood or urine be tested?What other tests may be done in addition to CSF analysis?1. What is a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) and how is it performed?The lumbar puncture is usually performed while you are lying on your side in a curled up fetal position but may sometimes be performed in a sitting position. It is important that you remain still during the procedure. Once you are in the correct position, your back is cleaned with an antiseptic and a local anesthetic is injected under the skin. When the area has become numb, a special needle is inserted through the skin, between two vertebrae, and into your spinal canal. An \"\"opening\"\" or initial pressure reading of the CSF is obtained. The health practitioner then collects a small amount of CSF in multiple sterile vials. A \"\"closing\"\" pressure is obtained, the needle is withdrawn, and a sterile dressing and pressure are applied to the puncture site. You will then be asked to lie quietly in a flat position, without lifting your head, for one or more hours to avoid a potential post-test headache.The lumbar puncture procedure usually takes less than half an hour. For most patients, it is a moderately uncomfortable procedure. The most common sensation is a feeling of pressure when the needle is introduced. Let your healthcare provider know if you experience a headache or any abnormal sensations, such as pain, numbness, or tingling in your legs, or pain at the puncture site.The lumbar puncture is performed low in the back, well below the end of the spinal cord. There are spinal nerves in the location sampled, but they have room to move away from the needle. There is the potential for the needle to contact a small vein on the way in. This can cause a \"\"traumatic tap,\"\" which just means that a small amount of blood may leak into one or more of the samples collected. While this is not ideal, it may happen a certain percentage of the time. The evaluation of your results will take this into account.^ Back to top2. Are there other reasons to do a lumbar puncture?Yes. Sometimes it will be performed to introduce anesthetics or medications into the CSF. Repeated punctures are sometimes used to decrease CSF pressure.^ Back to top3. Why do I need a spinal tap? Why can't my blood or urine be tested?Spinal fluid, obtained during a spinal tap, is often the best sample to use for conditions affecting your central nervous system because your CSF surrounds your brain and spinal cord. Changes in the elements of your CSF due to central nervous system diseases or other serious conditions are often first and most easily detected in a sample of your spinal fluid. Tests on blood and urine may be used in conjunction with CSF analysis to evaluate your condition.^ Back to top4. What other tests may be done in addition to CSF analysis?Other laboratory tests that may be ordered along with or following CSF testing include:• Blood culture to detect and identify bacteria in the blood• Cultures of other parts of the body to detect the source of the infection that led to meningitis or encephalitis• Blood glucose, total protein to compare with the concentration of CSF glucose and protein• CBC (complete blood count) to evaluate cell counts in blood• Antibodies for a variety of viruses, such as West Nile Virus• ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein), for indication of inflammation• CMP (comprehensive metabolic panel), a group of tests used to evaluate electrolyte balance and organ function^ Back to top\"\n",

Your link even says it: L = 4pi (R^2)sigma (T^4). Using L, luminosity, as the energy in this problem, you can find the radius R by doing sqrt (L/ (4pisigma (T^4)). Hope this helps everyone.Caroline · 4 years ago4 1 Comment (Stefan-Boltzmann law) L = 4pi*R^2*sigma*T^4 Solving for R we get: => R = (1/ (2T^2)) * sqrt (L/ (pi*sigma)) Plugging in your values you should get: => R = (1/ (2 (11,000K)^2)) *sqrt ( (2.7*10^32W)/ (pi * (5.67*10^-8 W/m^2K^4))) R = 1.609 * 10^11 m? · 3 years ago0 1 CommentMaybe you would like to learn more about one of these?Want to build a free website?

A line scan diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence with diffusion tensor analysis was applied to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient, to calculate relative anisotropy, and to delineate three-dimensional fiber architecture in cerebral white matter in preterm (n = 17) and full-term infants (n = 7). To assess effects of prematurity on cerebral white matter development, early gestation preterm infants (n = 10) were studied a second time at term. In the central white matter the mean apparent diffusion coefficient at 28 wk was high, 1.8 microm2/ms, and decreased toward term to 1.2 microm2/ms. In the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the mean apparent diffusion coefficients at both times were similar (1.2 versus 1.1 microm2/ms). Relative anisotropy was higher the closer birth was to term with greater absolute values in the internal capsule than in the central white matter. Preterm infants at term showed higher mean diffusion coefficients in the central white matter (1.4 +/- 0.24 versus 1.15 +/- 0.09 microm2/ms, p = 0.016) and lower relative anisotropy in both areas compared with full-term infants (white matter, 10.9 +/- 0.6 versus 22.9 +/- 3.0%, p = 0.001; internal capsule, 24.0 +/- 4.44 versus 33.1 +/- 0.6% p = 0.006). Nonmyelinated fibers in the corpus callosum were visible by diffusion tensor MRI as early as 28 wk; full-term and preterm infants at term showed marked differences in white matter fiber organization. The data indicate that quantitative assessment of water diffusion by diffusion tensor MRI provides insight into microstructural development in cerebral white matter in living infants.', 'title': 'Microstructural development of human newborn cerebral white matter assessed in vivo by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging.'}\n",
